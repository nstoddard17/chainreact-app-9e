// This is a new file, so we'll create the initial content here.
// Based on the updates, we need to ensure that any imports from '@/db' or '@/db/schema'
// are replaced with '@/lib/db' and '@/lib/db/schema' respectively.

// Example content (replace with actual schema exports as needed)
export * from "@/lib/db/schema/example-schema"

// You would add more schema exports here as needed.
