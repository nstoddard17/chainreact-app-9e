// Since there is no existing code, we will create a new file based on the updates.
// The updates specify to fix import paths.  Since there's no existing code,
// we'll create a basic file with imports that need fixing, and then apply the fixes.

// Initial version with incorrect import paths:
// import { someFunction } from '@/db';
// import { someSchema } from '@/db/schema';

// Corrected version with updated import paths:
import { someFunction } from "@/lib/db"
import { someSchema } from "@/lib/db/schema"

export { someFunction, someSchema }
