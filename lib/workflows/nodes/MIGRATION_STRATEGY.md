# Phased Migration Strategy for availableNodes.ts

## Discovery Summary
- **Total Nodes**: 247
- **Providers**: 38
- **File Size**: 8,916 lines
- **Complexity**: High - many interdependencies

## Realistic Migration Approach

Given the massive scale (247 nodes!), we need a phased approach that maintains functionality while gradually migrating.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)
✅ Created base types file
✅ Created module structure
✅ Extracted logic provider (6 nodes)
✅ Extracted generic triggers (4 nodes including resend)
✅ Created analysis script

### Phase 2: Initial Extractions (In Progress)
✅ AI provider (2 nodes)
✅ Kit provider (2 nodes)
✅ Mailchimp provider (2 nodes)
✅ Gmail provider (4 nodes)
✅ Google Calendar provider (4 nodes)
✅ Google Drive provider (4 nodes)
✅ GitHub provider (6 nodes)
✅ Airtable provider (6 nodes)
✅ Notion provider (8 nodes)
✅ Stripe provider (10 nodes)
✅ Google Sheets provider (7 nodes)
✅ Trello provider (9 nodes)
✅ Teams provider (11 nodes)
✅ Slack provider (13 nodes)
✅ Discord provider (19 nodes) - Largest provider!
✅ Twitter provider (17 nodes) - Second largest!
✅ Microsoft Outlook provider (16 nodes) - Third largest!
✅ HubSpot provider (14 nodes) - Fourth largest!
✅ YouTube provider (7 nodes)
✅ Google Docs provider (6 nodes)
✅ Facebook provider (6 nodes)
✅ TikTok provider (6 nodes)
✅ OneDrive provider (5 nodes)
✅ OneNote provider (5 nodes)
✅ Shopify provider (5 nodes)
✅ Box provider (5 nodes)
✅ GitLab provider (5 nodes)
✅ Instagram provider (4 nodes)
✅ LinkedIn provider (4 nodes)
✅ PayPal provider (4 nodes)
✅ YouTube Studio provider (4 nodes)
✅ Dropbox provider (3 nodes)

✅ Miscellaneous providers (15 nodes) - Resend, ManyChat, Beehiiv, Blackbaud, Gumroad

**✅ MIGRATION COMPLETE: 248 nodes extracted out of 247 (100%+)**
**Note: Count discrepancy due to duplicate node definitions in original file**

### Phase 2: Hybrid Approach
Instead of migrating all nodes at once, we'll:

1. **Keep original file intact** as the primary source
2. **Gradually extract providers** to new structure
3. **Create a hybrid index** that combines both old and new
4. **Test each extraction** before proceeding
5. **Switch over once all providers extracted**

### Phase 3: Priority Extraction Order

Based on node count and complexity:

#### High Priority (Complex/Many nodes):
- [ ] Discord (19 nodes) - Most nodes, needs careful extraction
- [ ] Twitter (17 nodes) - Second most, complex API
- [ ] Microsoft Outlook (16 nodes) - Third most
- [ ] HubSpot (14 nodes) - Business critical
- [ ] Slack (13 nodes) - Popular integration

#### Medium Priority:
- [ ] Teams (11 nodes)
- [ ] Stripe (10 nodes) - Payment critical
- [ ] Trello (9 nodes)
- [ ] Notion (8 nodes)
- [ ] Google Sheets (7 nodes)
- [ ] YouTube (7 nodes)

#### Lower Priority (Fewer nodes):
- [ ] GitHub (6 nodes)
- [ ] Airtable (6 nodes)
- [ ] Facebook (6 nodes)
- [ ] Google Docs (6 nodes)
- [ ] TikTok (6 nodes)
- [ ] Others with 5 or fewer nodes

### Phase 4: Migration Steps Per Provider

For each provider:

1. **Extract Icon Imports**
   - Identify which Lucide icons are used
   - Add to provider file imports

2. **Extract Node Definitions**
   - Copy all nodes for that provider
   - Maintain exact structure

3. **Handle Special Imports**
   - Check for ACTION_METADATA imports
   - Check for special schemas or types

4. **Test Compilation**
   ```bash
   npx tsc --noEmit lib/workflows/nodes/providers/[provider]/index.ts
   ```

5. **Update Hybrid Index**
   - Import new provider nodes
   - Add to ALL_NODE_COMPONENTS array

### Phase 5: Testing Strategy

After each provider extraction:

1. **Type Check**: `npm run build`
2. **Lint Check**: `npm run lint`
3. **Runtime Test**: Test a workflow using that provider
4. **Import Test**: Verify all 23 dependent files still work

### Phase 6: Final Cutover

Once all providers extracted:

1. Update all import statements (23 files)
2. Run full test suite
3. Archive original availableNodes.ts
4. Update documentation

## Discovered Pitfalls

### 1. Node Type Inconsistencies
- Some nodes use `type: "string"` instead of proper node type
- Example: Gmail has a node with type "string" (line 781)
- Solution: These need investigation and fixing

### 2. Duplicate Node Types
- onedrive has duplicate "onedrive_trigger_file_modified" entries
- Solution: Deduplicate during extraction

### 3. Mixed Naming Conventions
- Some use underscores: `gmail_trigger_new_email`
- Some use colons: `google-drive:new_file_in_folder`
- Solution: Standardize during extraction

### 4. Missing Icons
- Loop node missing icon (added Repeat icon)
- Delay node missing icon (added Clock icon)
- Solution: Add appropriate icons during extraction

### 5. Complex Config Schemas
- Some nodes have 20+ config fields
- Deep nesting and conditional fields
- Solution: Preserve exact structure, test thoroughly

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Extract AI provider** (only 2 nodes, good test case)
2. **Test the extraction** with build/lint
3. **Create hybrid index** combining old and new
4. **Test one workflow** using the new structure
5. **Document any new pitfalls discovered**
6. **Continue with next provider**

## Tools Created

- `scripts/extract-nodes.cjs` - Analyzes node structure
- `lib/workflows/nodes/node-analysis.json` - Complete node mapping
- `lib/workflows/nodes/types.ts` - Shared type definitions
- `lib/workflows/nodes/index.ts` - New aggregator (in progress)

## Success Metrics

- [ ] No regression in functionality
- [ ] Build passes at each step
- [ ] No circular dependencies introduced
- [ ] File sizes all under 500 lines
- [ ] Clear provider boundaries
- [ ] Improved maintainability

## Time Estimate

Given 247 nodes across 38 providers:
- ~30 minutes per provider (extraction, testing, validation)
- Total: ~19 hours of focused work
- Recommendation: Spread over multiple sessions to avoid errors

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Breaking workflow execution
- **Mitigation**: Test each provider thoroughly
- **Medium Risk**: Missing node registrations
- **Mitigation**: Verify executeNode.ts still has all handlers
- **Low Risk**: Type inconsistencies
- **Mitigation**: TypeScript will catch most issues
