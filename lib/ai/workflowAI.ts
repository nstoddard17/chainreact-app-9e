Rules:
1. ALWAYS start with a trigger node as the first node
2. ONLY use the node types listed above - do not create or suggest any other node types
3. Include action nodes that perform the described tasks
4. Connect nodes logically with proper flow
5. Position nodes in a top-to-bottom flow (y: 100, 300, 500, etc.) with x: 400 for center alignment
6. Include proper configuration for each node
7. If the user's request cannot be accomplished with the available nodes, suggest the closest alternative or explain what's missing
8. IMPORTANT: All nodes must have "type": "custom" and put the actual trigger/action type in "data.type"

CRITICAL: You must respond with ONLY valid JSON. Do not include any explanatory text, comments, or markdown formatting. Return ONLY the JSON object.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this format:

AI Agent - Modern Chain-Based Architecture (ai_agent):
IMPORTANT: AI Agents now use a chain-based architecture where you define multiple execution chains,
and the AI decides which chains to execute based on the input. Each chain can have multiple actions
that are configured with AI mode (AI decides all field values at runtime).

AI Summarize Content (ai_action_summarize):
"config": {
  "inputText": "{{Gmail: New Email → Body}}",
  "maxLength": 200,
  "style": "brief",
  "focus": "key points"
}

AI Extract Information (ai_action_extract):
"config": {
  "inputText": "{{Gmail: New Email → Body}}",
  "extractionType": "emails",
  "returnFormat": "list"
}

Schedule Trigger (schedule):
"config": {
  "cronExpression": "0 9 * * 1",
  "timezone": "America/New_York"
}

Webhook Trigger (webhook):
"config": {
  "method": "POST",
  "path": "/webhook/orders"
}

IMPORTANT: Each node's data object must include:
- "label": A short descriptive name (e.g., "Email Received", "Send Slack Message")
- "title": A more detailed title (e.g., "Gmail: New Email", "Slack: Send Message") 
- "type": The exact trigger/action type from the available list

AI AGENT INTEGRATION RULES:
- When including an AI Agent, ALWAYS place it between the trigger and action nodes
- Set inputNodeId to the previous node's ID (e.g., "node1" for the trigger)
- Connect the AI Agent to both the trigger (input) and the action (output)
- Use the AI Agent's output in subsequent actions (e.g., "{{AI Agent → goal}}")
- Choose appropriate customMemoryIntegrations based on the workflow context
- Write systemPrompt that matches the workflow's purpose and use case
- "isTrigger": true for trigger nodes, false for action nodes
- "providerId": The provider name (e.g., "gmail", "slack", "discord")
- "config": Configuration object with relevant settings

CONFIGURATION GUIDELINES:
1. ALWAYS populate the config object with realistic, specific values based on the user's request
2. Use specific variable references like {{Action Name → Field Name}} to reference data from previous nodes (e.g., {{Gmail: New Email → From}}, {{Slack: Send Message → Channel}})
3. For triggers, include relevant filters (from, subject, etc.)
4. For actions, include all required fields with meaningful values
5. For AI actions, reference previous node outputs in inputText fields using specific action and field names
6. Use realistic channel names, email addresses, and other identifiers
7. Include proper formatting for dates, times, and other structured data

AI AGENT CONFIGURATION GUIDELINES:
8. For AI Agent nodes, ALWAYS set inputNodeId to the previous node's ID (e.g., "node1" for the first trigger)
9. Set memory to "all-storage" for comprehensive context access
10. Include relevant customMemoryIntegrations based on the workflow (e.g., ["gmail", "slack"] for email workflows)
11. Write realistic systemPrompt that describes the AI's role and capabilities
12. Set tone to "professional", "friendly", or "casual" based on the use case
13. Set responseLength to 50-150 based on expected response complexity
14. Use "gpt-4o-mini" as the default model
15. Set temperature to 0.7 for balanced creativity and consistency
16. Set maxTokens to 1000-2000 based on expected response length
17. Set outputFormat to "text" for most use cases
18. Include selectedVariables object with relevant fields set to true (e.g., {"from": true, "subject": true, "body": true})

Node positioning example:
- Trigger node: {"x": 400, "y": 100}
- First action: {"x": 400, "y": 300}
- Second action: {"x": 400, "y": 500}
- Third action: {"x": 400, "y": 700}
