# Variable Drag & Drop - Implementation Status

## âœ… Issue Fixed

The drag and drop functionality was not working because the `Button` component with `asChild` prop in the `PopoverTrigger` wasn't properly forwarding drag event handlers.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Added drag event handlers to Combobox and MultiCombobox interfaces**
   - `onDrop`, `onDragOver`, `onDragLeave` props added

2. **Wrapped Button in a div to capture drag events**
   - The `PopoverTrigger` with `asChild` doesn't forward events properly to Button
   - Solution: Wrap with a div that has the drag handlers
   ```tsx
   <PopoverTrigger asChild>
     <div onDrop={onDrop} onDragOver={onDragOver} onDragLeave={onDragLeave}>
       <Button>...</Button>
     </div>
   </PopoverTrigger>
   ```

3. **GenericSelectField passes handlers to Combobox/MultiCombobox**
   - Handlers are passed directly to the components
   - Components now properly receive drop events

## How to Test

1. Open a workflow
2. Add a Discord trigger (e.g., "User Joined Server")
3. Add a Discord action (e.g., "Assign Role")
4. Open the configuration for "Assign Role"
5. Select a server to enable the User field
6. Drag a variable from the Variable Picker to the User dropdown
7. The field should accept the drop and show a friendly label like "Discord Username"

## Debug Logging

Console logs are in place:
- `ðŸŽ¯ [GenericSelectField] Drag over:` - When dragging over a field
- `ðŸŽ¯ [GenericSelectField] Variable dropped:` - When dropping on a field
- `âœ… [GenericSelectField] Variable accepted:` - When variable is successfully processed

## Features

- **Friendly Labels**: Shows "Discord Username" instead of `{{node_123.output.memberUsername}}`
- **All Integrations Supported**: Comprehensive field mapping for Discord, Gmail, Slack, Notion, GitHub, etc.
- **Visual Feedback**: Fields show blue ring when dragging over (if visual styles were kept)
- **Multi-select Support**: Can drop variables into multi-select fields too
