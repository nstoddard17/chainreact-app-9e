# Legacy Configuration Files

This folder contains legacy and backup files from the configuration refactoring effort. These files are kept for reference only and should NOT be used in production code.

## Files in this folder

### ConfigurationForm.backup.tsx
- **Size**: 8,600+ lines
- **Created**: During initial refactoring effort
- **Contains**: Original monolithic implementation with 1,300+ line handleFieldChange function
- **Status**: DEPRECATED - Do not use
- **Replaced by**: New modular ConfigurationForm.tsx with field change handler hooks

## Why these files exist

These files represent the "before" state of a major refactoring effort that:
1. Broke down an 8,600-line component into modular pieces
2. Extracted a 1,300-line handleFieldChange function into clean, testable hooks
3. Separated provider-specific logic into dedicated modules
4. Established a clean architecture for field dependency management

## Migration completed

The refactoring has been completed in three phases:
- **Phase 1**: Restored field dependency functionality
- **Phase 2**: Consolidated duplicate implementations
- **Phase 3**: Created modular provider-specific hooks

## DO NOT USE THESE FILES

These files are kept only for:
- Historical reference
- Emergency rollback (temporary only)
- Understanding the evolution of the codebase

All new development should use the new modular architecture.

## Deletion timeline

These files should be deleted after:
- All features verified working (âœ… Completed Sept 1, 2025)
- No issues for 2 weeks (Target: Sept 15, 2025)
- Team sign-off received
