# Fix Database Error - Beta Signup Issue

## Problem
You're getting a "Database error saving new user" (500 error) when trying to create a beta account. This is caused by conflicting database triggers that interfere with the auth.users table during user creation.

## Solution

### Step 1: Apply the Database Fix

Run the SQL in `fix-beta-signup-database-error.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor:

```bash
# This SQL will:
1. Remove ALL conflicting triggers on auth.users table
2. Create a simple trigger that only updates beta_testers status
3. Fix RLS policies on user_profiles table
4. Create helper functions for email confirmation
```

### Step 2: Deploy the Updated Code

The code has been updated to:
1. Fix the "supabase is not defined" error in username checking
2. Add proper Supabase client initialization
3. Handle email confirmation through RPC calls instead of triggers

### What Changed

#### Database Changes:
- **Removed**: Complex triggers that tried to modify auth.users during insert
- **Added**: Simple trigger that only updates beta_testers table status
- **Added**: Helper function `confirm_beta_tester_email` for email confirmation
- **Fixed**: RLS policies to allow proper profile creation

#### Code Changes:
- Fixed undefined `supabase` variable by using `createClient()` properly
- Added proper error handling for username checking
- Added RPC call to confirm beta tester email after signup
- Fixed timer cleanup for username availability checking

## Testing After Fix

1. **Clear any stuck beta tester records**:
```sql
-- Reset any beta testers that might be in a bad state
UPDATE beta_testers
SET status = 'active',
    conversion_date = NULL
WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';
```

2. **Test the signup flow**:
   - Navigate to beta signup URL with valid token
   - Fill out form with username
   - Submit and verify no database errors
   - Check that user lands on dashboard

3. **Verify in database**:
```sql
-- Check user was created
SELECT * FROM auth.users WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';

-- Check profile was created
SELECT * FROM user_profiles WHERE username = 'your-username';

-- Check beta tester status
SELECT * FROM beta_testers WHERE email = 'your-test-email@example.com';
```

## If Issues Persist

1. **Check for remaining triggers**:
```sql
SELECT tgname as trigger_name
FROM pg_trigger
WHERE tgrelid = 'auth.users'::regclass
AND tgname NOT LIKE 'RI_%';
```

2. **Check Supabase logs**:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard > Logs > Postgres
   - Look for errors during user creation

3. **Verify RLS policies**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename = 'user_profiles';
```

## Key Points

- The main issue was triggers trying to modify auth.users during INSERT
- Supabase doesn't allow certain modifications to auth.users during triggers
- Profile creation is now handled entirely client-side with retry logic
- Email confirmation for beta users is done via RPC call after user creation
- Beta tester status update is done in a simple, non-invasive trigger

## Success Indicators

✅ No "Database error saving new user" errors
✅ Username checking works without "supabase undefined" errors
✅ Beta users can complete signup successfully
✅ Users land directly on dashboard after signup
✅ Profile is created with username and beta-pro role
