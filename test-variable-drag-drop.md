# Variable Drag & Drop Test Plan

## Implementation Summary
✅ Variables can now be dragged from the Variable Picker sidebar and dropped into dropdown fields
✅ Friendly labels are displayed (e.g., "Discord Username") while the actual variable syntax is stored (e.g., `{{node_123.output.memberUsername}}`)
✅ Comprehensive field mapping for all major integrations

## How It Works

1. **Drag Source**: Variables in the VariablePickerSidePanel are draggable
   - Each variable has `draggable` attribute set
   - On drag, the variable syntax is set as plain text data

2. **Drop Target**: GenericSelectField accepts dropped variables
   - Wrapped in a div with drag event handlers
   - Shows blue highlight ring when dragging over
   - Accepts the drop and processes the variable

3. **Friendly Labels**: Smart mapping system
   - Extracts field name from variable syntax
   - Maps to integration-specific friendly names
   - Falls back to formatted field name if no mapping exists

## Supported Field Mappings

### Discord
- memberUsername → Discord Username
- memberTag → Discord Member Tag
- channelName → Discord Channel
- guildName → Discord Server
- roleId → Discord Role ID
- And many more...

### Gmail/Email
- from → Email From
- subject → Email Subject
- body → Email Body
- messageId → Email ID

### Slack
- text → Slack Message
- channel → Slack Channel
- username → Slack Username

### Other Integrations
- Notion, GitHub, Airtable, HubSpot, Trello, Google Calendar, Google Sheets, etc.

## Testing Steps

1. **Open Workflow Builder**
   - Create or edit a workflow
   - Add a Discord trigger (e.g., "User Joined Server")
   - Add a Discord action (e.g., "Assign Role")

2. **Test Drag & Drop**
   - Open the configuration modal for "Assign Role"
   - Open the Variable Picker sidebar (right side)
   - Expand the trigger node to see available variables
   - Drag "memberUsername" or "memberId" to the User dropdown
   - The field should show "Discord Username" or "Discord Member ID"
   - Save the configuration

3. **Verify Storage**
   - The actual value stored should be `{{node_id.output.memberUsername}}`
   - When reopening the modal, it should still show the friendly label

4. **Test Multiple Integrations**
   - Try with Gmail action dragging email fields
   - Try with Slack action dragging message fields
   - Each should show appropriate friendly labels

## Visual Feedback
- Dragging over a dropdown shows a blue ring and light blue background
- The cursor changes to indicate drop is allowed
- Dropped variables immediately show their friendly label

## Edge Cases Handled
- Variables from different node types get context-aware labels
- Unknown field names are automatically formatted
- Multi-select fields also support drag & drop
- Invalid drops (non-variables) are ignored
