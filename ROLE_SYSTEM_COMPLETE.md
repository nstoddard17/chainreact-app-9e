## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing

- [ ] Add an org member with each role type
- [ ] Change a member's role from one to another
- [ ] Remove a member (not yourself)
- [ ] Transfer ownership as owner
- [ ] Verify sidebar shows/hides correctly based on roles
- [ ] Try to perform unauthorized actions (should be blocked)
- [ ] Verify you cannot remove yourself
- [ ] Verify you cannot change your own role
- [ ] Verify cannot remove the last owner

### Edge Cases

- [ ] User with both org-level AND team-level roles
- [ ] Transfer ownership and verify old owner becomes admin
- [ ] Remove org-level role (user may still have team access)
- [ ] Add member who is already in teams but not org-level
- [ ] Try to add member with invalid email

---

## 🎯 Key Safeguards

1. **Cannot Remove Yourself** - Prevents accidental self-lockout
2. **Cannot Change Your Own Role** - Prevents privilege escalation
3. **Cannot Remove Last Owner** - Must transfer ownership first
4. **Only Owners Can Add Owners** - Prevents unauthorized owner creation
5. **Only Owners Can Transfer Ownership** - Protected critical action
6. **Role-Based UI** - Users only see actions they can perform

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### No Breaking Changes

✅ Existing team roles continue to work.
✅ Existing API calls remain functional.
✅ No user action required.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **No Invitation System Yet** - Can only add users who already have accounts
2. **No Audit Log** - Role changes aren't tracked historically
3. **No Bulk Operations** - Must add/remove members one at a time
4. **Email-Only Search** - Cannot search by username

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions

1. **Email Invitations** - Invite users who don't have accounts yet
2. **Audit Log** - Track all role changes with timestamps
3. **Bulk Import** - CSV upload for adding multiple members
4. **Role Templates** - Predefined permission sets
5. **Custom Roles** - Create organization-specific roles
6. **Notification System** - Email users when roles change
7. **2FA for Ownership Transfer** - Extra security for critical actions
8. **Role Expiration** - Temporary access grants

---

## ✨ Success!

The role system is now fully functional and ready for production use. Users with owner or admin privileges can manage organization members through the UI, and all permission checks are enforced at the API level.

**Next Steps**: Test in your environment and gather user feedback for future improvements!
