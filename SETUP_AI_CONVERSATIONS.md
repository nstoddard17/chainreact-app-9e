# AI Conversations Setup Guide

## Issue: Chat History Stuck on Loading

If your chat history is stuck on a loading spinner, it's likely because the `ai_conversations` table hasn't been created yet in your Supabase database.

## Solution: Create the Database Table

### Option 1: Using Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xzwsdwllmrnrgbltibxt
2. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy and paste the contents of `CREATE_AI_CONVERSATIONS_TABLE.sql` into the editor
5. Click **Run** (or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter)
6. You should see "Table created successfully!" message

### Option 2: Using Supabase CLI

```bash
# Make sure you have the Supabase CLI installed
# and you're linked to your project

npx supabase db execute --file CREATE_AI_CONVERSATIONS_TABLE.sql
```

## Verification

After running the SQL script:

1. Refresh your AI Assistant page
2. The loading spinner should disappear within 1-2 seconds
3. You should see "New Chat" placeholder when no conversations exist
4. New conversations will now appear in the sidebar with a typing animation

## Troubleshooting

If you still see the loading spinner after 10 seconds:
- Check your browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
- Make sure you're logged in
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that the table was created: Go to Supabase Dashboard → Table Editor → Look for `ai_conversations`

## What's Fixed

1. **UUID Validation**: The API now properly handles conversation IDs
2. **Table Missing Error**: API returns empty array instead of error when table doesn't exist
3. **Loading Timeout**: Loading state will automatically clear after 10 seconds if stuck
4. **Better Logging**: Debug logs help diagnose issues

## Features

- ✅ ChatGPT-style typing animation for new conversation titles
- ✅ Automatic conversation saving after first message
- ✅ Complete message history preservation
- ✅ Local responses (greetings, help) also saved to history
