## Messaging Framework

### Primary Headline
"Workflow automation that thinks for itself"

### Primary Value Prop
"Build intelligent workflows with AI that remembers your context, reads your documents, and makes smart decisions—all without writing code."

### Differentiation (WITHOUT naming competitors)
- **Traditional approach**: "Set rules, hope they work, manually fix when they break"
- **ChainReact approach**: "AI understands context, accesses your documents, and asks when unsure"

### Key Phrases
- "AI with memory" (not "AI that learns")
- "Document intelligence" (reads Google Drive, Notion)
- "Human-AI collaboration" (HITL)
- "Context-aware" (understands full workflow)
- "Deep integrations" (OAuth, webhooks, not just API)
- "Intelligent automation" (broader than just learning)

## What We Removed

### No Competitor Mentions
- Removed all references to Zapier, Make.com, n8n, Clay, Bardeen
- No "Not Another X Clone" messaging
