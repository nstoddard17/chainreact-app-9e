/**
 * Trigger activation registry.
 *
 * Slice 2e introduces a new seam V1 didn't have. V1 used a 779-line
 * `TriggerLifecycleManager` with per-provider lifecycle classes; V2's
 * `services/triggers/lifecycle.ts` is intentionally simpler — it just
 * upserts a trigger_resources row.
 *
 * For polling triggers we still need V1's "snapshot init at activation
 * time, not first poll" rule (CLAUDE.md "first poll miss" bug — the first
 * poll without a baseline silently drops events that arrived before it).
 * The minimum addition that buys us the rule is this registry: each
 * polling provider registers an `activate(node, integration)` function
 * that returns a `Partial<config>` (e.g. `{ snapshot: { historyId } }`)
 * which `lifecycle.ts` merges into `node.config` before persisting.
 *
 * Webhook triggers don't need this — the trigger_resources row is
 * sufficient on its own (Slack uses a single global webhook URL; future
 * providers that need per-workflow webhook subscriptions can use this
 * same hook by returning the subscription id).
 *
 * First match wins; registrations must be unique on (provider, eventType)
 * — the registrar throws on duplicate.
