/**
 * Trigger lifecycle service.
 *
 * Per docs/rules/workflow-lifecycle.md §"V2 intended behavior":
 *   - registerTrigger runs BEFORE persisting state during activate / resume
 *     (from eligible_to_resume). A throw aborts the transition; the
 *     orchestrator wraps with TRIGGER_REGISTRATION_FAILED.
 *   - unregisterTrigger runs AFTER persisting state during disable / delete
 *     and is best-effort (the orchestrator swallows errors). Webhook
 *     dispatcher (1J.3) independently guards against disabled / deleted
 *     workflows.
 *
 * For Slack the registration is purely a DB record — Slack's Events API
 * uses one global webhook URL per app, so per-workflow registration lives
 * in trigger_resources alone. Providers that need per-workflow
 * subscriptions (Microsoft Graph, Stripe webhooks, etc.) extend this
 * service with provider-side API calls when their slice ships.
 *
 * Slice 2e — activation hook seam: a (provider, eventType) may register an
 * activation function via `activationRegistry`. When present, lifecycle
 * calls it BEFORE the upsert and merges its returned partial config into
 * the node's config. Polling triggers (Gmail new_email) use this to fetch
 * the initial historyId snapshot — without it, the first poll establishes
 * a baseline and silently drops events that arrived between activation
 * and the first poll (V1 CLAUDE.md "first poll miss" bug).
 *
 * Manual-only workflows (zero trigger nodes) are a no-op — registration
 * doesn't apply, but the precondition checks in services/triggers/
 * preconditions.ts still run.
