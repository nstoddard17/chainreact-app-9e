## Alternative: Railway CLI (Optional)

If you prefer command line:

```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Initialize project
cd services/discord-gateway
railway init

# Set environment variables
railway variables set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-token"
railway variables set NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="https://your-app.vercel.app"

# Deploy
railway up
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid Token" Error
- Check that DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN is correct
- Make sure there are no extra spaces or quotes

### "Missing Intents" Error
- Go to Discord Developer Portal
- Bot Settings â†’ Privileged Gateway Intents
- Enable "Message Content Intent"

### "Cannot connect to webhook" Error
- Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL is correct
- Test the webhook manually:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhooks/discord/hitl \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"t":"MESSAGE_CREATE","d":{"content":"test"}}'
  ```

### Bot not responding to messages
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify bot is in the correct Discord server
- Verify bot has permissions to read messages in the channel
