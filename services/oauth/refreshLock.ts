/**
 * Process-local single-flight lock for OAuth token refreshes.
 *
 * Per docs/rules/oauth-dispatcher.md §"Edge cases" — concurrent refreshes for
 * the same `(userId, provider, accountId)` triple must collapse into one
 * provider call. The first caller starts the refresh; subsequent callers
 * wait on the same Promise and receive the same result. Without this, ten
 * parallel API calls hitting 401 simultaneously would each request a new
 * token, hammering the provider's refresh endpoint and racing each other to
 * write the row (with rotating-refresh-token providers, the loser's token
 * is invalidated server-side mid-flight).
 *
 * Scope: in-process only. Two Node processes serving the same user can each
 * trigger an independent refresh — the multi-instance distributed lock
 * (advisory locks via Postgres `pg_advisory_xact_lock`, or a Redis-backed
 * mutex) is explicitly deferred per the Slice 2 plan. For Slice 2b's
 * single-process dev / single-instance prod, this is sufficient.
 *
 * Lock key shape: `${userId}:${provider}:${accountId ?? "default"}` —
 * matches the `(user_id, provider, provider_account_id)` row-scoping the
 * `integrations` table uses. A user with two Slack workspaces refreshes
 * each independently.

 * starting a new one. The lock entry is cleared after `fn` settles
 * (resolves or rejects) so subsequent calls re-run `fn`.
 *
 * Concurrent callers MUST be requesting the same logical operation — the
 * dispatcher's `refresh()` is the only intended caller, and all callers
 * for the same key are by construction asking to refresh the same row.
