# AI Workflow Testing Summary

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Fixed Variable Scope Issue in stream-workflow route (RESOLVED ✅)
**Issue**: The `plan` variable was being shadowed inside the else block, causing `undefined` errors
**Location**: `/app/api/ai/stream-workflow/route.ts` lines 181-196
**Fix**: Changed from declaring a new `const plan` to properly assigning to outer scope variable

### 2. Fixed Indentation Issues (RESOLVED ✅)
**Issue**: Lines 198-256 had incorrect indentation, placing them inside the wrong scope
**Location**: `/app/api/ai/stream-workflow/route.ts` lines 198-256
**Fix**: Corrected indentation to ensure code runs in the proper scope

### 3. Fixed nodeId Reference Errors (RESOLVED ✅)
**Issue**: `nodeId` variable was not defined in the configuration loop scope
**Location**: `/app/api/ai/stream-workflow/route.ts` lines 390-720
**Fix**: Changed all `nodeId` references to `node.id` since node object was available

## Current Status

### Working ✅
- Login process works correctly
- Navigation to AI agent page works
- Text input is filled correctly ("when I get an email, send it to Slack")
- Server-side fixes are in place and no longer throwing errors

### Not Working ❌
- Send button click is not triggering the handleSendMessage function
- No workflow is being created
- No redirect to workflow builder is happening

## Issue Analysis

The test correctly:
1. Fills the textarea with the prompt text
2. Finds and clicks the send button
3. BUT the click event doesn't trigger the React handler

### Possible Causes
1. The button might be disabled (though we check for input.trim())
2. React event handlers might not be attached yet when we click
3. The click might be happening on the SVG icon instead of the button element
4. Need to wait for React to be ready after filling the text

## Test Execution Results

Multiple test runs show consistent behavior:
- Test successfully logs in
- Navigates to AI agent page
- Fills in text correctly (verified via screenshot)
- Clicks send button (test reports success)
- But no API calls are made and no redirect happens

## Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Add explicit wait after text input**: Wait for React to update state
2. **Click the button element directly**: Ensure we're clicking the button, not child elements
3. **Check button enabled state**: Verify button is not disabled before clicking
4. **Use page.click() with force**: Try `{ force: true }` option
5. **Alternative approach**: Use Enter key press which should also trigger send

## Files Modified

1. `/app/api/ai/stream-workflow/route.ts` - Fixed variable scope and indentation issues
2. `/test-ai-workflow-fixed.spec.ts` - Updated test to better handle send button

## Server Logs

The server logs show that when manually testing (00:33 and 00:43), the workflow creation and redirect work correctly. The issue is specifically with the automated test not properly triggering the button click event handler.
