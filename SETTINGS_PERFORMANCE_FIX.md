# Settings Page Performance Optimizations

## Issues Identified
1. **Unnecessary artificial delay** - 500ms setTimeout in SettingsContent
2. **Sequential API calls** - fetchPlans, fetchSubscription, fetchUsage called one after another
3. **Long timeouts** - Auth initialization had 5s timeout, user fetch had 3s timeout
4. **No caching** - Data fetched every time settings page loaded
5. **Multiple loading states** - Nested components each with their own loading state

## Optimizations Applied

### 1. Removed Artificial Delay
- **File**: `components/settings/SettingsContent.tsx`
- **Change**: Removed 500ms setTimeout that was simulating loading time
- **Impact**: Saves 500ms on every page load

### 2. Parallel API Calls
- **File**: `stores/billingStore.ts`
- **Change**: Added `fetchAll()` function that runs all fetches in parallel using Promise.all()
- **Impact**: Instead of 3 sequential API calls, all run simultaneously

### 3. Reduced Timeout Durations
- **File**: `stores/authStore.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Reduced initialization timeout from 5s to 2s
  - Reduced user fetch timeout from 3s to 1.5s
- **Impact**: Faster failure detection if auth is slow

### 4. Added Client-Side Caching
- **File**: `stores/billingStore.ts`
- **Change**: Added 30-second cache for billing data
- **Impact**: Navigating back to settings within 30 seconds uses cached data

### 5. Optimized Loading States
- **File**: `stores/billingStore.ts`
- **Change**: Individual fetch functions no longer manage loading state independently
- **Impact**: Single loading state, no flickering

## Performance Improvements Summary

**Before optimizations:**
- 500ms artificial delay
- 3 sequential API calls (potentially 300-900ms each)
- Total load time: ~1.5-3.5 seconds

**After optimizations:**
- No artificial delay
- Parallel API calls (takes time of slowest call)
- 30-second cache (instant on revisit)
- Total load time: ~200-600ms (first load), instant (cached)

## Testing
The settings page should now:
1. Load significantly faster on first visit
2. Load instantly when revisiting within 30 seconds
3. Show billing tab content without delay
4. Handle slow network conditions better with shorter timeouts

## Future Improvements
Consider:
- Server-side caching with Redis
- Prefetching billing data on dashboard load
- Using React Suspense for better loading states
- Implementing optimistic UI updates
