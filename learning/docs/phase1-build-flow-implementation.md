# Phase 1: Build Flow Execution - Implementation Complete

**Date**: November 1, 2025
**Status**: ✅ Core implementation complete, ready for testing

## Overview

Implemented the complete Build Flow execution system that allows users to:
1. See their flow plan in the React Agent chat menu
2. Click "Build" to construct the workflow
3. Provide user input for required fields (connections, channels, etc.)
4. Watch nodes being configured and tested sequentially
5. See visual feedback with node states (skeleton → ready → running → passed/failed)

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Integration Connection Detection ✅
**Files Modified**: `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx`

- Added `useIntegrationSelection` hook to check if integrations are connected
- In `handleBuild`: Checks all required integrations BEFORE placing nodes
- Shows clear error toast if any integrations are missing
- Prevents build from starting if integrations aren't connected

**Location**: `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx:998-1026`

### 2. Horizontal Node Layout ✅
**Files Modified**: `layout.ts`, `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx`

- Created `calculateHorizontalLayout()` function
- Places nodes in a horizontal row starting at `1120px + 80px` (chat panel width + offset)
- All nodes aligned vertically at y=200px
- Spacing: 300px (node width) + 160px (gap) between nodes

**Location**: `layout.ts:275-299`, `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx:1037-1044`

### 3. Smart Camera Zoom ✅
**Files Modified**: `layout.ts`

- Created `calculateSafeZoom()` function
- Prevents nodes from going outside viewport when they expand with fields
- Zoom levels based on estimated field count:
  - 1-3 fields: 0.7 zoom
  - 4-6 fields: 0.6 zoom
  - 7+ fields: 0.5 zoom

**Location**: `layout.ts:305-319`

### 4. Node State Management ✅
**Files Modified**: `layout.ts`

- Created `setNodeState()` function
- Updates both `node.data.state` and `node.className`
- States: skeleton, ready, running, passed, failed
- CSS animations automatically apply based on state

**Location**: `layout.ts:325-350`

### 5. Complete handleBuild Rewrite ✅
**Files Modified**: `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx`

**New Flow**:
1. Check integrations connected (blocks if missing)
2. Apply ALL edits at once (nodes + edges)
3. Apply horizontal layout
4. Set all nodes to skeleton state
5. Fit view to show all skeleton nodes (zoom 0.85)
6. Wait 500ms for user to see full skeleton
7. Zoom in on first node (safe zoom ~0.6-0.7)
8. Transition to WAITING_USER

**Location**: `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx:995-1095`

### 6. State Lifting for User Input ✅
**Files Modified**: `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx`, `FlowV2AgentPanel.tsx`

- Lifted `nodeConfigs` state from FlowV2AgentPanel to WorkflowBuilderV2
- Added `onNodeConfigChange` callback
- FlowV2AgentPanel now receives nodeConfigs as prop
- User input is now accessible to handleContinueNode

**Locations**:
- State: `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx:194`
- Callback: `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx:1159-1167`
- Props Interface: `FlowV2AgentPanel.tsx:43-60`

### 7. Complete handleContinueNode Implementation ✅
**Files Modified**: `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx`

**Sequential Node Configuration Flow**:
1. Get user input from nodeConfigs
2. Update node data.config with user values
3. Change state: skeleton → ready (300ms pause)
4. AI configures remaining fields (stubbed - TODO)
5. Change state: ready → running (500ms pause)
6. Test node (stubbed as always success - TODO)
7. Change state: running → passed/failed (based on test)
8. Pan camera to next node (maintain safe zoom)
9. Repeat for next node OR complete if done

**Location**: `WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx:1097-1199`

## Flow Plan UI (Already Working)

The flow plan pills in the React Agent chat menu (FlowV2AgentPanel) already:
- ✅ Show all nodes in the plan
- ✅ Expand when WAITING_USER for that node
- ✅ Show connection dropdown (if required)
- ✅ Show required field inputs (channel, server, etc.)
- ✅ Have Continue and Skip buttons

**Location**: `FlowV2AgentPanel.tsx:298-436`

## Visual Flow (User Experience)

### Before Build:
1. User types: "When I get an email, send it to Slack"
2. AI creates flow plan showing: Gmail Trigger → Slack Send Message
3. User sees "Build" button

### During Build:
1. Click "Build"
2. All nodes appear as grey skeletons in a horizontal row
3. Camera shows full skeleton view
4. Camera zooms to first node

### Node-by-Node Configuration:
**For each node:**
1. Pill expands in chat showing required inputs
2. User selects connection (Gmail account)
3. User selects channel/server (if needed)
4. Clicks "Continue"
5. Node turns from grey (skeleton) → normal (ready)
6. Fields start populating (AI configuration - stubbed)
7. Node turns blue with shimmer (running)
8. Node validates/tests
9. Node turns green (passed) or red (failed)
10. Camera pans to next node

### After All Nodes:
1. Status shows "Complete"
2. All nodes are green (passed)
3. Workflow is ready to publish

## TODO Items for Phase 2

### High Priority
1. **AI Field Auto-Configuration** (stubbed at line 1138-1140)
   - Integrate with AI service to populate non-user fields
   - Example: Email body, Slack message text, etc.

2. **Node Testing** (stubbed at line 1147-1150)
   - Implement actual API validation
   - For triggers: Verify webhook setup, credentials valid
   - For actions: Send test API request (don't actually execute)
   - Return success/failure + any fetched data

3. **Dynamic Field Options** (TODO at FlowV2AgentPanel.tsx:403)
   - Load channel lists for Slack/Discord
   - Load folder lists for Drive/OneDrive
   - Load board lists for Monday/Trello

### Medium Priority
4. **Node Schema Audit**
   - Verify ALL integration node schemas match APIs
   - Ensure config modal shows correct fields
   - Check that auto-configured fields section shows same fields as config modal

5. **Only Show Populated Fields in Nodes**
   - Filter `data.config` to only show keys with values
   - Hide optional sections if no fields populated
   - Location: `CustomNode.tsx` (need to add filtering)

6. **Message Preview for Slack/Discord**
   - Show preview of message in config modal
   - Allow user to see exactly what will be sent
   - Document for future implementation

### Low Priority
7. **Advanced Node Testing**
   - Implement context menu → Test Node functionality
   - Allow testing individual nodes outside build flow
   - Show test results in modal

8. **Error Recovery**
   - If node fails, allow user to fix config and retry
   - Don't force rebuild of entire workflow

9. **Build Cancel Behavior**
   - Clean up partial builds properly
   - Reset node states to skeleton

## Files Modified

   - Remove local state, use props instead

## Testing Checklist

Before marking Phase 1 complete, test:

- [ ] User can create flow plan with "when I get an email, send to Slack"
- [ ] Build button appears after plan is ready
- [ ] Clicking Build checks Gmail/Slack are connected
- [ ] If not connected, shows clear error
- [ ] If connected, places nodes horizontally starting after chat panel
- [ ] All nodes appear as grey skeletons
- [ ] Camera shows full skeleton view first
- [ ] Camera zooms to first node (Gmail trigger)
- [ ] First node pill expands showing connection dropdown
- [ ] User can select Gmail connection
- [ ] Clicking Continue transitions node through states
- [ ] Node changes: skeleton → ready → running → passed
- [ ] Camera pans to second node (Slack)
- [ ] Second node pill expands
- [ ] User selects Slack connection and channel
- [ ] Clicking Continue configures second node
- [ ] After both nodes: Shows "Complete"
- [ ] Nodes maintain horizontal layout
- [ ] Zoom level prevents overflow when fields populate

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **AI Configuration is Stubbed**
   - Currently just waits 400ms
   - Doesn't actually call AI to configure fields
   - Fields won't populate automatically yet

2. **Node Testing is Stubbed**
   - Always returns success
   - Doesn't validate connections
   - Doesn't make API calls

3. **Dynamic Options Not Loading**
   - Channel dropdowns won't populate yet
   - Need to implement API calls to fetch options

4. **No Field Filtering Yet**
   - Nodes might show all fields even if not populated
   - Need to add filtering in CustomNode.tsx

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 is considered successful if:
- ✅ Integration check prevents build with missing connections
- ✅ Nodes place horizontally starting after chat panel
- ✅ Camera flow works (skeleton view → zoom to node)
- ✅ User can provide input in expanded pills
- ✅ Nodes transition through states visually
- ✅ Camera pans node-to-node sequentially
- ⏳ User can complete full flow end-to-end (needs testing)

## Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Test the complete flow with real workflow
2. **Fix Issues**: Address any bugs found during testing
3. **Phase 2 Planning**: Prioritize TODO items
4. **AI Integration**: Implement actual field auto-configuration
5. **Node Testing**: Build real validation/testing logic
6. **Schema Audit**: Verify all integration schemas complete

## Architectural Decisions

### Why Horizontal Layout?
- Chat panel takes 1120px on left
- Horizontal layout keeps nodes visible
- User can see progression left-to-right
- Matches natural reading order

### Why Sequential Configuration?
- One node at a time reduces cognitive load
- User sees immediate feedback
- Easier to debug which node failed
- Matches natural workflow thinking

### Why State-Based Visual Feedback?
- Clear indication of what's happening
- User knows when to provide input
- Visual progress indicator
- Matches design system

### Why Stubbed AI/Testing?
- Get MVP working first
- Can enhance incrementally
- Reduces complexity for Phase 1
- Easier to test core flow

## Performance Considerations

- Horizontal layout is instant (no dagre calculation)
- State transitions use CSS animations (GPU accelerated)
- Camera pans use ReactFlow's optimized viewport
- No performance issues expected with <50 nodes

## Accessibility

- ✅ Keyboard navigation in input fields
- ✅ Focus management for Continue button
- ⏳ Screen reader announcements for state changes (TODO)
- ⏳ High contrast mode support for node states (TODO)
