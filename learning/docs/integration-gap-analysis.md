## Strategic Recommendations

### 1. Focus on Top 3 Providers First
Gmail, Slack, and Notion are the "big 3" productivity tools. Closing gaps here will have outsized impact on user satisfaction.

### 2. Leverage Quick Wins
The Slack migration (8 nodes already coded) is a perfect quick win to show progress and build momentum.

### 3. Pattern Recognition
Many gaps follow similar patterns:
- **Content management** (page content, email attachments, etc.)
- **Advanced search/find operations**
- **Batch operations** (create multiple, delete multiple)
- **User/team operations** (list users, permissions)

Build reusable patterns/templates for these common needs.

### 4. Unified Actions Were a Good Decision
Our Google Sheets and Notion unified actions show this pattern works well. Consider applying to other providers:
- Mailchimp (all subscriber operations in one node)
- HubSpot (all contact operations in one node)

### 5. Don't Compete on Everything
Zapier/Make have 1000s of nodes. Focus on:
- Top 80% of use cases for each provider
- Features that enable common automation patterns
- Differentiators (our AI features, visual builder)

---

## Competitive Positioning

### Where We Excel
1. **Modern UX** - Visual builder, real-time updates
2. **AI Integration** - AI field values, agent builder
3. **Airtable** - Excellent coverage with advanced features (webhook filtering, deduplication)
4. **Google Sheets** - Comprehensive with visual column mapping

### Where We're Behind
1. **Notion** - Missing page content management (critical gap)
2. **Gmail** - Missing 10+ common actions
3. **Slack** - 8 nodes coded but not migrated

### Closing the Gap
Following the priority recommendations above will bring us to **90%+ feature parity** with Zapier/Make for our top 5 integrations within 4-6 weeks of focused development.
