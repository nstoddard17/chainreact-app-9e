## Next Steps

**Immediate (Today):**
1. Review and approve this roadmap
2. Decide which phase to start with
3. Set up project tracking (GitHub Projects, Linear, etc.)

**This Week:**
1. Implement tabs infrastructure
2. Start Path/If-Else node implementation
3. Create reusable CriteriaBuilder component

**This Month:**
1. Complete Phase 1-3 (Foundation + Core Nodes + Management)
2. Beta test with select users
3. Gather feedback and iterate

**Next Month:**
1. Complete Phase 4-6 (Scheduling + AI + Polish)
2. Launch publicly
3. Monitor usage and iterate based on data

---

## Questions for Discussion

1. **Should we implement in this exact order, or prioritize differently?**
2. **Do we need all features before launch, or can we ship iteratively?**
3. **Should AI features (Phase 5) come before or after Scheduling (Phase 4)?**
4. **What's the minimum viable feature set to compete with Zapier?**
5. **Should we focus on breadth (many features) or depth (fewer features, very polished)?**
