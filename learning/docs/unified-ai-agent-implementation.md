# Unified AI Agent - Complete Implementation

**Created:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready
**Complexity:** High

## 📌 Overview

The **Unified AI Agent** combines three powerful capabilities into a single, professional node:
1. **Message Generation** - Create intelligent content, emails, responses
2. **Smart Routing** - Analyze and route workflows to different paths
3. **Hybrid Mode** - Generate content AND route based on the result

This replaces the old `ai_router` and `ai_message` nodes with a cleaner, more powerful solution.

## 🎯 What Changed

### Before (Old System)
- ❌ Two separate nodes: `AI Message` and `AI Router`
- ❌ Confusing for users ("which one do I use?")
- ❌ Couldn't combine generation + routing in one step
- ❌ Duplicate configuration (model, API settings, etc.)

### After (Unified AI Agent)
- ✅ Single `AI Agent` node with mode selection
- ✅ Clear interface with three distinct modes
- ✅ Can generate AND route in one step (hybrid mode)
- ✅ Shared configuration, less duplication
- ✅ Professional, polished UX

## 🔧 Three Modes Explained

### 1. Message Generation Mode 📝

**Use Case:** Generate content, draft emails, create responses, etc.

**Example:**
```
Input: Customer email asking about refund policy
↓
AI Agent (Message Mode)
  - Model: GPT-4o Mini
  - Prompt: "Draft a professional response about our refund policy"
  - Output Fields: subject, body, tone
↓
Output: {
  output: "Dear Customer...",
  structured_output: {
    subject: "Re: Refund Policy Question",
    body: "Thank you for reaching out...",
    tone: "professional"
  }
}
```

**Configuration:**
- **System Prompt**: Optional behavior instructions
- **Message Prompt**: What to generate (supports variables like `{{trigger.email}}`)
- **Structured Output Fields**: Define specific fields to extract
- **Context From Steps**: Include data from previous workflow steps

**Perfect For:**
- Email responses
- Content generation
- Summarization
- Data transformation

---

### 2. Smart Routing Mode 🎯

**Use Case:** Analyze content and route workflow to different paths based on AI decision

**Example:**
```
Input: Support ticket
↓
AI Agent (Router Mode)
  - Template: Support Router
  - Paths: Bug Report | Feature Request | Support Query | Sales
↓
AI analyzes and routes to: "Bug Report"
↓
Workflow continues down "Bug Report" path
```

**Pre-configured Templates:**
1. **Support Ticket Router** 🎯
   - Routes to: Bug Report, Feature Request, Support Query, Sales, General

2. **Content Moderator** 🛡️
   - Routes to: Approved, Needs Review, Rejected

3. **Lead Qualifier** 💰
   - Routes to: Hot Lead, Warm Lead, Cold Lead, Not a Lead

4. **Urgency Classifier** ⚡
   - Routes to: Critical, High Priority, Medium Priority, Low Priority

5. **Custom Router** 🔧
   - Define your own routing logic

**Configuration:**
- **Router Template**: Choose pre-configured or custom
- **Output Paths**: Define 2-10 routing paths
- **Decision Mode**: Single path or multi-path routing
- **Include Reasoning**: Get AI's explanation for decisions

**Perfect For:**
- Support ticket routing
- Lead qualification
- Content moderation
- Priority classification
- Conditional workflow branching

---

### 3. Hybrid Mode ⚡ (NEW!)

**Use Case:** Generate content AND route based on what was generated

**Example:**
```
Input: Customer complaint email
↓
AI Agent (Hybrid Mode)
  - Generate draft response
  - Analyze if manager approval needed
↓
Output: {
  output: "Dear Customer, we apologize for...",
  structured_output: { subject: "...", body: "..." },
  selectedPath: "needs_approval"  ← Routes based on generated content
}
↓
Workflow routes to "Needs Approval" path
```

**Real-World Scenario:**
```
Trigger: New support email received
↓
AI Agent (Hybrid Mode)
  Message: Draft professional response
  Router: Determine if auto-send or needs review
↓
If simple query → auto_send path → Send Email
If complex/sensitive → needs_review path → Notify Manager → HITL → Send Email
```

**Configuration:**
- **All message settings** (prompts, output fields, etc.)
- **All routing settings** (templates, paths, etc.)
- **Combined power** of both modes!

**Perfect For:**
- Smart email automation with approval workflows
- Content generation with quality gates
- Dynamic response with conditional routing
- Complex multi-step decision making

  ↓
Returns ActionResult with appropriate outputs
```

## 🎓 Best Practices

### When to Use Each Mode

**Message Mode:**
- ✅ Need to generate content
- ✅ Want structured output fields
- ✅ Single workflow path
- ❌ Don't need routing logic

**Router Mode:**
- ✅ Need conditional workflow branching
- ✅ Want AI-powered decisions
- ✅ Multiple possible paths
- ❌ Don't need to generate content

**Hybrid Mode:**
- ✅ Generate content AND route
- ✅ Route based on generated content
- ✅ Approval workflows
- ✅ Quality gates

### Tips for Better Results

1. **Use descriptive prompts** - Be specific about what you want
2. **Leverage structured output** - Extract specific fields for later use
3. **Set appropriate temperature** - Lower (0-0.3) for consistency, higher (0.7-1.0) for creativity
4. **Include context** - Use `contextNodeIds` to provide additional information
5. **Use templates** - Pre-configured router templates are optimized and tested
6. **Monitor costs** - Set `costLimit` to prevent runaway expenses
7. **Test in sandbox** - Always test before deploying to production

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: AI not routing correctly

**Solution:**
- Check routing template matches your use case
- Increase/decrease `minConfidence` threshold
- Add more specific instructions in system prompt
- Review AI reasoning output

### Issue: Generated content not structured

**Solution:**
- Define `outputFields` properly (use `field | description` format)
- Check temperature (lower = more consistent)
- Verify output in raw format first

### Issue: Costs too high

**Solution:**
- Switch to cheaper model (GPT-4o Mini or Claude Haiku)
- Reduce `maxTokens`
- Set strict `costLimit`
- Use caching where possible

## 🎉 Summary

The Unified AI Agent is a **game-changer** for workflow automation:

✅ **Simpler** - One node instead of two
✅ **More Powerful** - Hybrid mode unlocks new patterns
✅ **Professional** - Polished UX with templates and presets
✅ **Flexible** - Three modes cover all use cases
✅ **Cost-Effective** - Shared config reduces redundancy

**Migration:**

**Total Impact:**
- **Lines of Code:** ~1200 new, ~800 deleted
- **Net Change:** +400 lines (more features, same complexity)
- **Files:** 2 new, 4 deleted, 2 modified
- **Modes:** 3 (message, router, hybrid)
- **Templates:** 5 pre-configured
- **Production Ready:** ✅ Yes
