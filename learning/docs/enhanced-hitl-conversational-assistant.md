# Enhanced HITL Conversational Assistant

**Created:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented
**Complexity:** High

## 📌 Overview

The Enhanced HITL (Human-in-the-Loop) system transforms workflow automation into an intelligent conversational experience. Instead of simple approve/reject decisions, users engage in natural, multi-turn conversations with an AI assistant that understands context, searches files, and adapts to different workflow types.

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Critical Issues Resolved

1. **Sandbox Mode Bug** ❌→✅
   - **Problem:** Workflows tested in sandbox mode would resume in production mode after HITL conversations
   - **Root Cause:** `testMode` was hardcoded to `false` in webhook handler (line 360)
   - **Solution:** Preserved `testMode` flag through the pause/resume cycle
   - **Files Changed:**
     - `app/api/webhooks/discord/hitl/route.ts:375-397` - Added testMode preservation
     - `lib/workflows/actions/hitl/index.ts:726` - Store testMode in resume_data

2. **Thread-Based Isolation** ❌→✅
   - **Problem:** Discord threads created isolation instead of natural conversation
   - **Solution:** Removed thread creation, messages now appear directly in channel
   - **Files Changed:**
     - `lib/workflows/actions/hitl/discord.ts:17-77` - Simplified to direct channel messages

3. **Static Message Format** ❌→✅
   - **Problem:** Messages didn't adapt to workflow context (email vs task vs general)
   - **Solution:** AI-powered dynamic message generation based on workflow type
   - **Files Changed:**
     - `lib/workflows/actions/hitl/enhancedConversation.ts` - New intelligent messaging system

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Context-Aware Message Formatting

The system automatically detects workflow type and formats messages appropriately:

#### Email Response Workflows
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────
│ 📧 **EMAIL**
├─────────────────────────────────────────
│ **From:** john@example.com
│ **To:** support@company.com
│ **Subject:** Question about pricing
│ **Date:** 10/21/2025, 2:30 PM
├─────────────────────────────────────────
│ Hi, I'm interested in your Enterprise plan.
│ Could you send me more details?
└─────────────────────────────────────────

┌─────────────────────────────────────────
│ ✍️  **DRAFT RESPONSE**
├─────────────────────────────────────────
│ **Subject:** Re: Question about pricing
├─────────────────────────────────────────
│ Hi John,
│
│ Thanks for your interest! I'd be happy to share
│ details about our Enterprise plan...
└─────────────────────────────────────────

**Would you like me to send this?**

You can:
• Say "yes" or "send it" to proceed
• Ask me to change something
• Request additional information from our files
```

#### Task Management Workflows
Automatically formats tasks, projects, and issues with relevant details

#### General Workflows
Presents workflow data in a clear, structured format

### 2. Intelligent File Search

When users mention policies, documents, or files, the AI can search across connected storage:

**User:** "Can you check our refund policy first?"

**Assistant:** "I can search for 'refund policy' in Google Drive and Notion. Which would you like me to check?"

**Supported Providers:**
- Google Drive
- Google Docs
- OneDrive
- Notion
- Dropbox

**Implementation:**
- `enhancedConversation.ts:getConnectedStorageIntegrations()` - Detects what's connected
- `enhancedConversation.ts:searchFiles()` - Searches across providers
- `enhancedConversation.ts:processEnhancedConversation()` - Integrates search into conversation flow

### 3. Multi-Turn Conversational Intelligence

The AI maintains conversation context and can:
- Answer questions about workflow data
- Suggest modifications
- Explain what will happen next
- Search for additional information
- Detect approval signals naturally

**Example Conversation:**

```
User: What email did I receive?

AI: You received an email from john@example.com asking about pricing for our Enterprise plan.

User: Do we have a standard response for this?

AI: I can search our documentation for pricing templates. Would you like me to check Google Drive or Notion?

User: Google Drive

AI: Let me search for "pricing template" in your Google Drive...
[Search results would appear here]

User: Use the second one and send it

AI: Perfect! I'll use the Enterprise pricing template and send the response. Continuing the workflow...
```

### 4. Dynamic Trigger/Action Detection

The system intelligently detects what triggered the workflow and what action is being taken:

```typescript
export function detectWorkflowContext(input: Record<string, any>): {
  type: 'email_response' | 'task_management' | 'general'
  triggerData: any
  actionData: any
  description: string
}
```

This powers context-aware messaging and intelligent suggestions.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
lib/workflows/actions/hitl/
├── index.ts                      # Main HITL action handler
├── conversation.ts               # Original conversation logic (fallback)
├── enhancedConversation.ts       # NEW: Enhanced AI conversation system
├── discord.ts                    # Discord integration (updated)

└── route.ts                      # Webhook handler (updated with testMode fix)
```

### Key Functions

#### `enhancedConversation.ts`

1. **`generateContextAwareMessage()`**
   - Detects workflow type (email, task, general)
   - Formats email/draft for display
   - Generates conversational opening message
   - Falls back gracefully if AI fails

2. **`processEnhancedConversation()`**
   - Handles multi-turn conversations
   - Detects file search requests
   - Identifies approval signals
   - Extracts variables from conversation
   - Returns structured response with actions

3. **`formatEmailForDisplay()`**
   - Creates inbox-style email display
   - Shows from, to, subject, date, body
   - Uses box-drawing characters for visual clarity

4. **`formatDraftResponse()`**
   - Displays draft email responses
   - Shows subject and body
   - Clear visual separation

5. **`getConnectedStorageIntegrations()`**
   - Queries database for user's connected apps
   - Filters to storage providers only
   - Returns list of available search targets

6. **`searchFiles()` (Placeholder)**
   - Framework for multi-provider file search
   - Currently returns empty (ready for implementation)
   - Will integrate with Google Drive, OneDrive, Notion APIs

### Conversation Flow

```
1. Workflow triggers → HITL node executes
2. Enhanced system detects context (email/task/general)
3. AI generates context-aware opening message
4. Message sent to Discord channel (no thread)
5. User responds → Webhook receives message
6. Enhanced conversation processor analyzes response
7. AI determines action:
   ├─ Need more info → Continue conversation
   ├─ File search requested → Offer search options
   └─ Approval detected → Resume workflow
8. Workflow continues with extracted variables
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Auto-Detect Mode (Recommended)

```typescript
{
  type: "hitl_conversation",
  config: {
    channel: "discord",
    discordGuildId: "{{discordServer}}",
    discordChannelId: "{{channelId}}",
    autoDetectContext: true, // Enable smart formatting
    enableMemory: true,
    timeoutPreset: "30", // 30 minutes
    timeoutAction: "cancel"
  }
}
```

### Manual Mode

```typescript
{
  type: "hitl_conversation",
  config: {
    channel: "discord",
    discordGuildId: "{{discordServer}}",
    discordChannelId: "{{channelId}}",
    autoDetectContext: false,
    initialMessage: "Custom message: {{data}}",
    systemPrompt: "You are a custom assistant...",
    extractVariables: {
      "decision": "User's decision",
      "notes": "Additional context"
    }
  }
}
```

## 🐛 Debugging

### Issue: Sandbox workflows resume in production mode

**Fixed in this update!**

Check logs for:
```
[HITL Resume] Execution context created {
  testMode: true,  // Should match original
  preservedFromResume: true
}
```

### Issue: Messages creating threads instead of channel posts

**Fixed in this update!**

Discord integration now sends directly to channel:
```typescript
// Old: Created threads
const threadData = await createThread(...)

// New: Direct channel messages
const messageData = await sendToChannel(...)
```

### Issue: Generic messages instead of context-aware formatting

**Fixed in this update!**

Messages now adapt to content:
```typescript
const context = detectWorkflowContext(input)
// Returns: email_response | task_management | general
const message = await generateContextAwareMessage(input, config)
```
