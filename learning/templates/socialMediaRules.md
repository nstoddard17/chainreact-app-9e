# Social Media Update Rules

## Format Requirements

When updating the `learning/logs/socialMedia.md` file, follow these rules:

### Writing Style
- **Plain English** - no technical jargon or specific code references
- **Paragraph form** - easy to break into Twitter/X posts (not bullet points or lists)
- **User-focused** - explain why changes matter to regular users, not developers
- **Story-driven** - describe the problem → solution → benefit clearly
- **Relatable language** - use everyday terms like "broken", "nightmare", "sneaky bug"

### Content Structure
- Start with what was actually broken or problematic from a user perspective
- Explain the solution in terms anyone can understand
- Focus on the real-world impact and benefits users will experience
- Avoid mentioning specific file names, code functions, or technical implementation details

### Target Audience
- General population who will see these as Twitter/X posts
- People who may not be technical but are interested in product development
- Focus on the "why this matters" rather than the "how we did it"

### Example Good Format
"We completely rebuilt how email fields work in our workflow builder. The old system was basically broken - dropdowns wouldn't close properly, scrolling was weird, and selecting multiple emails was a nightmare. We threw it all out and built something that actually works like normal web dropdowns should."

### Example Bad Format
"Fixed EmailAutocomplete component issues by replacing with MultiCombobox and implementing integration-specific field architecture in FieldRenderer.tsx with provider routing to Gmail/Outlook/Discord components."
