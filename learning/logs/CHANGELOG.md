## [2024-12-31] – Discord Server Selection Issue Investigation

### Problem
- Discord server dropdown shows options but selection doesn't work
- When user clicks on a server option, dropdown closes but no value is selected
- Config modal shows all fields instead of just server field initially

### Investigation & Fixes Applied
- **Updated `getVisibleFields` function**: Added special handling for Discord actions to only show server field initially
- **Enhanced `handleFieldChange` function**: Added server-side logging to track field value changes
- **Added server-side debugging to `FieldRenderer`**: Added logging to see what options are available for Discord guilds
- **Fixed Discord guilds loading**: Updated `useDynamicOptions` to use `loadDiscordGuildsOnce` for Discord guilds
- **Created debug logging API**: Added `/api/debug/log` endpoint for server-side debugging

### Current State
- ✅ Discord guilds are loading successfully (confirmed in server logs)
- ✅ Config modal now shows only server field initially for Discord actions
- ✅ After server selection, other fields (channel, message) should appear
- ✅ Discord bot status is working (confirmed in server logs)
- 🔍 **Investigating**: Why server selection isn't working (dropdown closes without selecting)

### Server-Side Debugging Added
- Server logging in `handleFieldChange` to track when server is selected
- Server logging in `FieldRenderer` to see available options for guildId field
- New `/api/debug/log` endpoint for centralized debugging
- Server logs show Discord guilds are being fetched successfully

### Files Modified
- `components/workflows/configuration/ConfigurationForm.tsx` - Added Discord-specific field visibility logic and server-side logging
- `components/workflows/configuration/hooks/useDynamicOptions.ts` - Added Discord guilds special handling
- `components/workflows/configuration/fields/FieldRenderer.tsx` - Added server-side debugging for Discord guilds
- `app/api/debug/log/route.ts` - New debug logging API endpoint

### Next Steps
- Test Discord send message configuration modal
- Check server logs for debugging information (look for "DEBUG LOG" entries)
- Verify if server selection is working with the new logic
- Test Discord bot status feature after server selection

## [2025-08-10] – Config Modal Footer Spacing Equalized

- Adjusted configuration form footer to have symmetrical vertical padding so Save/Cancel buttons are vertically centered within the footer without changing their horizontal position.

### Files Modified:
- `components/workflows/configuration/ConfigurationForm.tsx` – Switched `pt-6 pb-8` to `py-6` on the footer container.

### Next Steps:
- Verify visual consistency across theme modes and screen sizes.
