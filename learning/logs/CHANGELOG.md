## [2025-01-02] – Fixed Build Errors and Syntax Issues

- Fixed multiple syntax errors in support pages and components
- Resolved ESLint version conflicts by updating to ESLint 8.57.0
- Fixed Suspense boundary issues for components using `useSearchParams()`
- Added dynamic rendering for profile page to handle cookies usage
- Recreated corrupted support ticket detail page with proper structure
- Fixed Resend API key initialization causing build-time errors

### Files Modified:
- `package.json` - Updated ESLint version from 8.56.0 to 8.57.0
- `app/support/page.tsx` - Fixed extra closing braces causing syntax error
- `app/support/tickets/[id]/page.tsx` - Recreated entire file due to corruption
- `components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Added Suspense wrapper for useSearchParams
- `components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx` - Added Suspense wrapper for useSearchParams
- `app/invite/page.tsx` - Added Suspense wrapper for useSearchParams
- `app/invite/signup/page.tsx` - Added Suspense wrapper for useSearchParams
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Added dynamic rendering export
- `app/api/organizations/[id]/invite/route.ts` - Moved Resend initialization inside function
- `app/api/support/tickets/route.ts` - Moved Resend initialization inside function
- `app/api/support/tickets/[id]/responses/route.ts` - Moved Resend initialization inside function

### Technical Details:
- **ESLint Version Conflict**: The TypeScript ESLint plugin required ESLint ^8.57.0 but the project was using 8.56.0
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Next.js 15 requires components using `useSearchParams()` to be wrapped in Suspense boundaries
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Pages using cookies need `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static generation errors
- **Syntax Errors**: Several files had corrupted JSX structure with misplaced code after function closing braces
- **Resend API Key Issue**: Top-level Resend initialization was causing build-time errors when environment variables weren't available

### Build Status:
✅ **Build now passes successfully** - All syntax errors and runtime issues resolved

## [2025-01-02] – Fixed Integration Webhooks Page

- Fixed integration webhooks API to show all available integrations instead of querying non-existent database table
- Updated API to use `detectAvailableIntegrations()` from availableIntegrations.ts
- Added fallback mechanism to generate webhook configurations from available integrations
- Fixed TypeScript linter error with authType comparison
- Improved error handling for missing database tables

### Files Modified:
- `app/api/integration-webhooks/route.ts` - Complete rewrite to use available integrations instead of database queries
- `learning/logs/CHANGELOG.md` - Added this changelog entry

### Technical Details:
- The original API was trying to query a `integration_webhooks` table that didn't exist in the database
- The new implementation generates webhook configurations dynamically from the `availableIntegrations.ts` file
- Each integration gets appropriate webhook URLs, trigger types, and setup instructions
- The API now handles both cases: when the database table exists (returns stored data) and when it doesn't (generates from available integrations)

### Next Steps:
- Move additional template components to learning folder
- Implement sync-docs.ts automation script
- Create standardized template for component documentation
- Consider running the migration to create the `integration_webhooks` table for persistent storage
- Add webhook execution tracking functionality
- Implement actual webhook endpoint handlers for each integration

- **Fix**: Added conditional styling that applies primary border and background to selected actions
- **Result**: Users can now clearly see which action is currently selected, improving usability

## [2024-12-19] – OAuth Security Improvement: Server-Side Google Sign-In

### Security Enhancement
- **Moved Google Sign-In from client-side to server-side OAuth**
- **Problem**: Client-side OAuth exposed Client ID in browser source code
- **Solution**: Created server action `app/actions/google-auth.ts` for secure OAuth URL generation
- **Benefits**: Better security, consistent with integration OAuth pattern, improved state management

### Implementation Changes
- Created `app/actions/google-auth.ts` - Server action for Google sign-in initiation
- Updated `stores/authStore.ts` - Now uses server action instead of client-side OAuth URL generation
- **Removed dependency** on `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` for sign-in flow
- **Added secure state management** using database storage instead of sessionStorage

### Environment Variables Simplified
- **Before**: Required both `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- **After**: Only need `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` (server-side only)
- **Security**: Client ID no longer exposed in browser source code

### Files Modified:
- `app/actions/google-auth.ts` - Created (new file)
- `stores/authStore.ts` - Updated to use server action
- `learning/logs/CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with this entry

### Next Steps:
- Test the new server-side Google sign-in flow
- Consider applying same pattern to other OAuth providers if needed
- Update documentation to reflect the simplified environment variable setup

## [2024-12-19] – OAuth Flow Analysis and Environment Variable Fix

### OAuth Implementation Review
- Conducted comprehensive security analysis of OAuth flow
- Identified strengths: token encryption, CSRF protection, error handling
- Found areas for improvement: inconsistent PKCE, missing rate limiting, state parameter security

### Environment Variable Fix
- **Problem**: `client_id=undefined` in OAuth URLs due to missing `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix
- **Solution**: Updated `stores/authStore.ts` to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`
- **Root Cause**: Client-side code accessing `process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` without proper prefix

### Documentation Added
- Created `learning/docs/OAuth-Flow.md` - Comprehensive OAuth implementation guide
- Created `learning/walkthroughs/OAuth-Flow.md` - Detailed technical walkthrough
- Documented security features, common issues, and best practices

### Files Modified:
- `stores/authStore.ts` - Fixed environment variable reference
- `learning/docs/OAuth-Flow.md` - Created (new file)
- `learning/walkthroughs/OAuth-Flow.md` - Created (new file)
- `learning/logs/CHANGELOG.md` - Updated with this entry

### Security Assessment:
- **Score**: 7.5/10
- **Strengths**: Token encryption, CSRF protection, error handling
- **Needs Improvement**: PKCE consistency, rate limiting, state parameter security

### Next Steps:
- Implement PKCE for all supported OAuth providers
- Add rate limiting to OAuth endpoints
- Improve state parameter security with cryptographically secure random
- Consider implementing token rotation for enhanced security
