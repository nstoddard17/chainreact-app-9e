## [2025-01-02] – Fixed Build Errors and Syntax Issues

- Fixed multiple syntax errors in support pages and components
- Resolved ESLint version conflicts by updating to ESLint 8.57.0
- Fixed Suspense boundary issues for components using `useSearchParams()`
- Added dynamic rendering for profile page to handle cookies usage
- Recreated corrupted support ticket detail page with proper structure
- Fixed Resend API key initialization causing build-time errors

### Files Modified:
- `package.json` - Updated ESLint version from 8.56.0 to 8.57.0
- `app/support/page.tsx` - Fixed extra closing braces causing syntax error
- `app/support/tickets/[id]/page.tsx` - Recreated entire file due to corruption
- `components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Added Suspense wrapper for useSearchParams
- `components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx` - Added Suspense wrapper for useSearchParams
- `app/invite/page.tsx` - Added Suspense wrapper for useSearchParams
- `app/invite/signup/page.tsx` - Added Suspense wrapper for useSearchParams
- `app/profile/page.tsx` - Added dynamic rendering export
- `app/api/organizations/[id]/invite/route.ts` - Moved Resend initialization inside function
- `app/api/support/tickets/route.ts` - Moved Resend initialization inside function
- `app/api/support/tickets/[id]/responses/route.ts` - Moved Resend initialization inside function

### Technical Details:
- **ESLint Version Conflict**: The TypeScript ESLint plugin required ESLint ^8.57.0 but the project was using 8.56.0
- **Suspense Boundaries**: Next.js 15 requires components using `useSearchParams()` to be wrapped in Suspense boundaries
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Pages using cookies need `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static generation errors
- **Syntax Errors**: Several files had corrupted JSX structure with misplaced code after function closing braces
- **Resend API Key Issue**: Top-level Resend initialization was causing build-time errors when environment variables weren't available

### Build Status:
✅ **Build now passes successfully** - All syntax errors and runtime issues resolved

## [2025-01-02] – Fixed Integration Webhooks Page

- Fixed integration webhooks API to show all available integrations instead of querying non-existent database table
- Updated API to use `detectAvailableIntegrations()` from availableIntegrations.ts
- Added fallback mechanism to generate webhook configurations from available integrations
- Fixed TypeScript linter error with authType comparison
- Improved error handling for missing database tables

### Files Modified:
- `app/api/integration-webhooks/route.ts` - Complete rewrite to use available integrations instead of database queries
- `learning/logs/CHANGELOG.md` - Added this changelog entry

### Technical Details:
- The original API was trying to query a `integration_webhooks` table that didn't exist in the database
- The new implementation generates webhook configurations dynamically from the `availableIntegrations.ts` file
- Each integration gets appropriate webhook URLs, trigger types, and setup instructions
- The API now handles both cases: when the database table exists (returns stored data) and when it doesn't (generates from available integrations)

### Next Steps:
- Consider running the migration to create the `integration_webhooks` table for persistent storage
- Add webhook execution tracking functionality
- Implement actual webhook endpoint handlers for each integration
