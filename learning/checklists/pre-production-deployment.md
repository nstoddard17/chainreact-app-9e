# Pre-Production Deployment Checklist

Use this checklist before merging `development` â†’ `main` to ensure safe, successful production deployments.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Before starting checklist
git checkout development
git pull origin development
npm run build  # Must succeed before proceeding
```

---

## 1. Code Quality & Build

### Build & Compile
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully with no errors
- [ ] `npm run lint` passes with no errors
- [ ] TypeScript compilation has no errors
- [ ] No unresolved merge conflicts

### Code Review
- [ ] All console.log/console.error/console.warn removed or justified
- [ ] No commented-out code blocks
- [ ] No TODO/FIXME comments that block deployment
- [ ] No debug code (debugger statements, test credentials)
- [ ] Logging follows `/learning/docs/logging-best-practices.md` (no tokens/PII)

### Dependencies
- [ ] No unnecessary dependencies added
- [ ] All dependencies in package.json are actively used
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)
- [ ] Dependencies compatible with production Node version

---

## 2. Testing & Quality Assurance

### Development Deployment Testing
- [ ] Feature tested on development deployment (chainreact-dev.vercel.app)
- [ ] All user flows tested end-to-end
- [ ] Error states tested (network errors, validation errors, etc.)
- [ ] Loading states tested (slow network simulation)

## 11. Final Pre-Merge Steps

### Git Hygiene

- [ ] No WIP commits or temporary commits
- [ ] Branch up to date with latest development
  ```bash
  git checkout development
  git pull origin development
  ```

### Build Verification
- [ ] Final build test passes
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
- [ ] No warnings that need addressing
- [ ] Bundle size acceptable

### Team Communication
- [ ] Team notified of upcoming deployment
- [ ] Deployment time scheduled (avoid Friday afternoons!)
- [ ] Someone available to monitor deployment
- [ ] Rollback person identified

---

## 12. Merge Execution

### Standard Merge Process
```bash
# 1. Ensure development is ready
git checkout development
git pull origin development
npm run build  # Final verification

# 2. Switch to main and merge
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge development

# 3. Review changes one last time
git log --oneline -10
git diff origin/main

# 4. Push to trigger production deployment
git push origin main
```

### If Database Migrations Needed
```bash
# 1. Apply migrations to production database FIRST
export SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-token"
supabase link --project-ref [prod-project-ref]
supabase db push

# 2. Verify migrations succeeded
# Check Supabase dashboard for errors

# 3. Then deploy code
git checkout main
git merge development
git push origin main
```

---

## 13. Post-Deployment Monitoring (First 15 Minutes)

Immediately after pushing to main:

### Vercel Deployment
- [ ] Deployment started in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Build phase completes successfully
- [ ] No build errors or warnings
- [ ] Deployment promoted to production

### Logs Monitoring
```bash
# Watch deployment logs
vercel logs --follow
```
- [ ] No error spikes in logs
- [ ] No 500 errors
- [ ] Response times normal

### Quick Smoke Tests
- [ ] Production site loads (https://chainreact.app)
- [ ] Login flow works
- [ ] Create new workflow works
- [ ] Execute test workflow succeeds
- [ ] Integration connections work

### Database Health
- [ ] Supabase logs show no errors
- [ ] Query performance normal
- [ ] No RLS policy violations
- [ ] Connection pool healthy

### Integration Health
- [ ] Test webhook from each integration type
- [ ] Verify trigger resources created
- [ ] Check webhook delivery logs

---

## Emergency Rollback Procedure

If critical issues detected after deployment:

### Option 1: Instant Vercel Rollback (Fastest)
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Deployments
2. Find previous successful deployment
3. Click "..." menu â†’ "Promote to Production"
4. Instant cutover to previous version

### Option 2: Git Revert
```bash
git checkout main
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Triggers new deployment with previous code
```

### Option 3: Database Rollback (if migrations failed)
```bash
# Connect to production database
supabase link --project-ref [prod-project-ref]

# Manually run rollback SQL
# Or restore from backup if data corrupted
```

## Notes

- **Don't skip steps**: Each check exists because we've been burned before
- **When in doubt, wait**: Better to delay than deploy broken code
- **Test on development first**: Always validate on dev deployment
- **Monitor actively**: First 15 minutes are critical
- **Have rollback ready**: Know how to roll back before you deploy
