# Workflow Builder Synchronization Implementation

## Date: September 1, 2025

## Overview
Implemented a synchronized workflow builder design between the main workflow builder page and the AI Agent node configuration modal. Both now use the same visual components and support real-time synchronization.

## Problem
The AI Agent node's workflow builder had a different design from the main workflow builder, creating an inconsistent user experience. The builders needed to:
1. Look identical visually
2. Support multiple workflow chains
3. Synchronize changes in real-time
4. Use the same node and edge components

## Solution

### 1. Shared Components Created

#### ChainFlowNode.tsx
- Unified node component with consistent styling
- Compact, modern design with gradient backgrounds
- Icon display and handle positioning
- Plus button on hover for adding nodes
- Support for trigger, AI agent, and action nodes

#### ChainFlowEdge.tsx
- Custom edge component with plus button at midpoint
- Support for chain colors and conditional styling
- Interactive insertion points

### 2. New Flow Builders

#### AIAgentFlowBuilder.tsx
- Complete ReactFlow-based builder matching main builder
- Multiple chains support with tabs
- Visual node palette for adding actions
- Drag-and-drop support
- Mini-map and controls

#### AIAgentSimpleFlowBuilder.tsx
- Simplified version for testing and fallback
- Clean, minimal implementation
- Demonstrates core workflow concepts

### 3. Synchronization System

#### workflowChainStore.ts
- Zustand store for managing chains
- Cross-builder state management
- Event-based synchronization

#### useWorkflowSync.ts
- Hook for real-time synchronization
- Automatic change propagation
- Bidirectional updates

## Implementation Details

### File Changes

1. **Components**
   - `/components/workflows/shared/ChainFlowNode.tsx` - Shared node component
   - `/components/workflows/shared/ChainFlowEdge.tsx` - Shared edge component
   - `/components/workflows/AIAgentFlowBuilder.tsx` - Full flow builder
   - `/components/workflows/AIAgentSimpleFlowBuilder.tsx` - Simple flow builder

2. **Stores**
   - `/stores/workflowChainStore.ts` - Chain synchronization store

3. **Hooks**
   - `/hooks/useWorkflowSync.ts` - Synchronization hook

4. **Updated Files**
   - `/components/workflows/WorkflowBuilder.tsx` - Added chain support
   - `/components/workflows/AIAgentModal.tsx` - Integrated new builder
   - `/components/workflows/ChainActionConfigModal.tsx` - Updated imports
   - `/components/workflows/AIAgentWorkflowPreview.tsx` - Updated imports

### Key Features

1. **Visual Consistency**
   - Same node styling with rounded corners and shadows
   - Identical handle positions and sizes
   - Plus buttons for adding nodes (on hover)
   - Same color scheme and gradients

2. **Multiple Chains**
   - Tab-based chain navigation
   - Color coding for chain identification
   - Conditional execution support

3. **Real-time Sync**
   - Changes in one builder reflect immediately
   - Event-based communication
   - State persistence across modals

## Usage

### In AI Agent Modal
```tsx
<AIAgentSimpleFlowBuilder
  chains={chains}
  onChainsChange={setChains}
/>
```

### In Main Workflow Builder
```tsx
const { chains, syncChain } = useWorkflowSync({
  workflowId: workflowId,
  nodes,
  edges,
  onNodesChange: setNodes,
  onEdgesChange: setEdges
})
```

## Current Status

The AI Agent modal now shows the "Chains" tab by default with a simplified ReactFlow-based builder that matches the main workflow builder's design. The simple version is currently active to ensure proper rendering in the modal environment.

## Next Steps

1. Migrate all features from AIAgentChainBuilder to AIAgentFlowBuilder
2. Test synchronization between builders
3. Add persistence to database
4. Implement undo/redo functionality
5. Add keyboard shortcuts

## Troubleshooting

If ReactFlow doesn't render in modal:
1. Ensure proper height is set (min-height: 400px)
2. Check that @xyflow/react styles are imported
3. Verify nodeTypes and edgeTypes are defined
4. Use simplified version as fallback

## Notes

- ReactFlow requires explicit height to render properly
- Modal environments need overflow handling
- Event-based sync prevents circular updates
- Simplified version serves as both test and fallback
