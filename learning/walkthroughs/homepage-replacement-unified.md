# Homepage Replacement with UnifiedHomepage

## Date: October 15, 2025

## Overview
Replaced the main homepage (/) with the UnifiedHomepage component that was previously at /home, providing a more polished and feature-rich landing experience for users.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backup Created
- Original `app/page.tsx` backed up to `app/page.backup.tsx`
- Backup contains the original LandingPage component import
- Can be restored if needed by renaming back to `page.tsx`

### 2. Homepage Updated
- Main homepage (`/`) now uses UnifiedHomepage component
- Same component that was previously only accessible at `/home`
- Includes metadata for SEO optimization

### 3. OAuth Flow Preview Enhanced
Fixed multiple issues with the "Connect Your Apps" preview:

#### Integration Display
- Changed from generic icons to actual integration logos
- Updated "Calendar" to "Google Calendar"
- Added more descriptive text for each integration

#### Mouse Cursor Positioning
- Cursor now appears directly over the Slack Connect button
- OAuth window cursor positioned over the Authorize button
- Removed upside-down orientation (removed rotate-180)
- Made cursors slightly larger (w-5 h-5) for better visibility

#### Visual Improvements
- Removed scrollbar from integration grid
- OAuth popup now shows actual Slack logo
- Better positioning with z-index adjustments

## Files Modified
- `/app/page.tsx` - Now imports UnifiedHomepage
- `/app/page.backup.tsx` - Backup of original with LandingPage
- `/components/homepage/HowItWorks.tsx` - OAuth flow improvements

## How to Revert
If you need to revert to the original homepage:

```bash
# Delete current page.tsx
rm app/page.tsx

# Rename backup to page.tsx
mv app/page.backup.tsx app/page.tsx
```

## Benefits of UnifiedHomepage
- Interactive preview windows showing actual UI
- Better animations and user experience
- Waitlist integration
- More comprehensive feature showcase
- Professional OAuth flow demonstration
