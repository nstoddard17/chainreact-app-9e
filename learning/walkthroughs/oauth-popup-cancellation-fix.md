# OAuth Popup Cancellation Fix

## Problem
When users tried to connect certain OAuth providers (HubSpot, OneNote, and other Microsoft services), they would receive an "OAuth cancelled by user" error even though the authentication was successful. This happened because these providers close the popup window before sending the success message back to the parent window.

## Root Cause
The popup manager was treating all popup closures as cancellations, except for HubSpot which was previously fixed. Microsoft OAuth (including OneNote, Outlook, Teams, OneDrive) has the same behavior where the popup closes before the success message is sent.

## Solution
Extended the popup cancellation logic to handle all providers that exhibit this behavior by resolving the promise instead of rejecting it when the popup closes.

## Implementation

### Modified: `/lib/oauth/popup-manager.ts`

```typescript
onCancel = () => {
  originalOnCancel()
  // For HubSpot and Microsoft providers, don't reject - the cancel handler will check if it actually succeeded
  // These providers may close the popup before sending the success message
  const providersToResolve = [
    'hubspot', 
    'microsoft-onenote', 
    'onenote',
    'microsoft-outlook',
    'outlook',
    'teams',
    'onedrive'
  ]
  
  if (providersToResolve.includes(provider)) {
    resolve() // Resolve instead of reject for these providers
  } else {
    reject(new Error("OAuth cancelled by user"))
  }
}
```

## Providers Affected
The following providers now properly handle popup closure without throwing errors:
- HubSpot (previously fixed)
- Microsoft OneNote
- Microsoft Outlook  
- Microsoft Teams
- OneDrive

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Try connecting each Microsoft provider
2. Complete the OAuth flow
3. Verify no "OAuth cancelled" error appears
4. Check that the integration shows as connected

## Prevention
When adding new OAuth providers:
1. Test if the provider closes the popup before sending success message
2. If yes, add the provider ID to the `providersToResolve` array
3. Consider implementing a more robust solution that checks for actual success/failure rather than relying on popup closure

## Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **Timeout-based approach**: Wait a few seconds after popup closes to check if integration was created
2. **Polling approach**: Continuously check the database for new integration
3. **Server-side redirect**: Handle success entirely server-side without popup messaging

The current solution was chosen for simplicity and consistency with the existing HubSpot fix.
