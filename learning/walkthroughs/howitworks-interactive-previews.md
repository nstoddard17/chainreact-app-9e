# Interactive Preview Windows in HowItWorks Component

## Overview
Enhanced the HowItWorks section preview windows to show realistic, interactive mockups instead of abstract shapes. This provides users with a better understanding of the actual ChainReact interface and workflow process.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Connect Your Apps Preview
**Before**: Simple colored boxes with app names
**After**: Realistic integration page mockup

Features added:
- Integration cards with proper icons (Mail, Users, FileText)
- Connect/Connected button states with animations
- OAuth popup simulation for Slack integration
- Proper descriptions for each integration
- Interactive hover states on buttons

Key animations:
- Staggered card entrance (0.15s delay between each)
- OAuth popup springs in with authorization animation
- Connected state transitions smoothly

### 2. Design Your Workflow Preview
**Before**: Static nodes in a row
**After**: Interactive workflow builder interface

Features added:
- Workflow builder header with Save/Activate buttons
- Canvas with grid background (theme-aware dots)
- Animated workflow nodes appearing sequentially:
  - Trigger (green gradient)
  - Filter (purple-pink gradient)
  - Send Email (blue-cyan gradient)
- Animated connection lines between nodes
- Dragging simulation showing a new "Action" node being added
- Plus button for adding new nodes

Key animations:
- Nodes pop in with spring animation
- Connection lines draw using pathLength animation
- New node repeatedly demonstrates drag-and-drop motion
- Gradients on connection lines for visual appeal

### 3. Activate & Relax Preview
**Before**: Simple rotating circle with execution count
**After**: Complete workflow dashboard

Features added:
- Dashboard header with active status indicator
- Statistics grid showing:
  - Total Executions: 1,247
  - Success Rate: 99.8%
- Recent executions list with status indicators
- Activity graph showing workflow execution frequency
- Real-time status updates (running workflow simulation)

Key animations:
- Pulsing active status indicator
- Staggered stats appearance
- Activity bars grow with spring animation
- Running execution shows pulsing yellow indicator

## Technical Implementation

### Animation Techniques Used
1. **Framer Motion**: All animations use framer-motion
2. **Spring Physics**: Node appearances use spring transitions
3. **Staggered Delays**: Sequential animations create flow
4. **Path Animations**: SVG paths animate for connections
5. **Repeat Animations**: Dragging simulation repeats infinitely

### Theme Awareness
- Grid backgrounds adapt to light/dark mode
- All colors and borders respect theme
- Gradient overlays adjust opacity based on theme

### Component Structure
```typescript
{activeStep === 0 && <IntegrationsPreview />}
{activeStep === 1 && <WorkflowBuilderPreview />}
{activeStep === 2 && <DashboardPreview />}
```

## User Experience Benefits
1. **Better Understanding**: Users see actual UI instead of abstract shapes
2. **Process Visualization**: Each step shows the real workflow
3. **Interactive Feel**: Animations demonstrate the dynamic nature
4. **Professional Appearance**: Realistic mockups build trust
5. **Educational Value**: Users learn the interface before signing up
