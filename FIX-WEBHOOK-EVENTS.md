# ✅ SOLUTION FOUND: Wrong Webhook Events Configured

## The Problem
Your webhook is receiving `payment_intent.created` events, but we need `checkout.session.completed` events to save subscription data.

## Fix This Now (2 minutes)

### Go to Stripe Dashboard
1. Navigate to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/webhooks
2. Click on your webhook endpoint: `https://chainreact.app/api/webhooks/stripe-billing`

### Update Event Types
3. Click "Update endpoint" or the "..." menu → "Update details"
4. In the "Events to send" section, you need these events CHECKED:
   - ✅ `checkout.session.completed` (MOST IMPORTANT)
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.created`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.updated`
   - ✅ `customer.subscription.deleted`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_succeeded`
   - ✅ `invoice.payment_failed`

5. You can UNCHECK these (not needed):
   - ❌ `payment_intent.created`
   - ❌ `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - ❌ Any other payment_intent events

6. Click "Update endpoint"

## Why This Fixes It

- **Current**: Stripe sends `payment_intent.created` when payment starts
- **Needed**: We need `checkout.session.completed` which fires AFTER successful payment
- The checkout session contains all the metadata (user_id, plan_id, etc.)
- Payment intents don't have this subscription metadata

## Verify It's Working

After updating:
1. Make a test purchase
2. Check Stripe Dashboard → Your webhook → "Webhook attempts"
3. You should see `checkout.session.completed` events
4. Check your logs for: `[Stripe Webhook] Processing checkout.session.completed`
5. Check Supabase subscriptions table for new record

## What the Logs Showed

✅ **Good signs**:
- Webhook is reaching your server
- Signature verification is passing
- Checkout session is creating successfully with metadata

❌ **The issue**:
- Only receiving `payment_intent.created` events
- Not receiving `checkout.session.completed` events

## That's it!
This should fix your issue immediately. The webhook handler code is already set up correctly - it just needs the right events.
