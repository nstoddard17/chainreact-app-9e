# VariablePicker Integration Test Guide

## 🧪 Testing the VariablePicker in AllFieldsSelector

This guide helps you verify that the VariablePicker has been successfully integrated into the "All Available HubSpot Fields" section.

### **✅ What Should Work Now:**

1. **VariablePicker Button**: Each selected field should now have a database icon button (🗄️) next to the input field
2. **Variable Selection**: Clicking the database button should open the VariablePicker dialog
3. **Variable Insertion**: Selecting a variable should insert it into the field value
4. **All Field Types**: VariablePicker should work for all field types:
   - Text inputs
   - Textarea fields
   - Number fields
   - Date fields
   - Select dropdowns
   - Boolean checkboxes

### **🔍 How to Test:**

#### **Step 1: Open the Configuration Modal**
1. Go to your workflow builder
2. Add a HubSpot "Create Contact" action
3. Click "Configure" on the action

#### **Step 2: Select Some Fields**
1. In the "All Available HubSpot Fields" section
2. Check the checkbox next to several different field types:
   - A text field (e.g., "First Name")
   - A textarea field (e.g., "Description")
   - A number field (e.g., "Annual Revenue")
   - A date field (e.g., "Birth Date")
   - A select field (e.g., "Industry")

#### **Step 3: Test VariablePicker**
1. For each selected field, you should see:
   - The input field on the left
   - A database icon button (🗄️) on the right
2. Click the database icon button
3. The VariablePicker dialog should open
4. Browse through available variables from previous nodes
5. Select a variable
6. The variable should be inserted into the field

#### **Step 4: Verify Different Field Types**
- **Text/Textarea**: Variable should be inserted as text
- **Number**: Variable should be inserted as a number
- **Date**: Variable should be inserted as a date
- **Select**: Variable should be inserted as the selected value
- **Boolean**: Variable should be inserted as true/false

### **🎯 Expected Behavior:**

#### **Before (Without VariablePicker):**
```
[Input Field]                    (no variable picker)
```

#### **After (With VariablePicker):**
```
[Input Field] [🗄️]              (with variable picker button)
```

### **🔧 Technical Details:**

#### **Components Modified:**
1. **AllFieldsSelector.tsx**:
   - Added VariablePicker import
   - Added workflowData and currentNodeId props
   - Modified renderFieldInput to include VariablePicker for all field types
   - Created renderInputWithVariablePicker helper function

2. **ConfigurationModal.tsx**:
   - Updated AllFieldsSelector usage to pass workflowData and currentNodeId props

#### **Field Types Supported:**
- ✅ Text inputs
- ✅ Textarea fields  
- ✅ Number fields
- ✅ Date fields
- ✅ Select dropdowns
- ✅ Boolean checkboxes
- ✅ Fields with existing values

### **🚨 Troubleshooting:**

#### **If VariablePicker Button Doesn't Appear:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify that workflowData and currentNodeId are being passed
3. Ensure VariablePicker component is properly imported

#### **If VariablePicker Dialog Doesn't Open:**
1. Check if there are any JavaScript errors
2. Verify that the trigger button is properly configured
3. Ensure the dialog component is working

#### **If Variables Don't Insert:**
1. Check the onVariableSelect callback
2. Verify that the field value is being updated correctly
3. Ensure the variable format is correct for the field type

### **📝 Notes:**

- The VariablePicker shows variables from all previous nodes in the workflow
- Variables are formatted as `{{nodeId.fieldName}}`
- The VariablePicker respects field types and shows compatible variables
- All selected fields now have consistent variable picker functionality

### **🎉 Success Criteria:**

✅ VariablePicker button appears next to all selected fields
✅ Clicking the button opens the VariablePicker dialog
✅ Variables can be selected and inserted into fields
✅ Works for all field types (text, number, date, select, boolean)
✅ Variables are properly formatted and inserted
✅ No console errors or TypeScript errors
