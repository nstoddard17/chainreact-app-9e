## 🎯 Before You Test

### 1. Apply Database Migration (2 minutes)

**Required for chat persistence to work.**

1. Open Supabase Studio: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/xzwsdwllmrnrgbltibxt
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy & paste from: `/supabase/migrations/agent_chat_persistence_v2.sql`
5. Click **RUN**
6. Verify success: "Success. No rows returned"

**Without this**: Chat messages won't persist across page refreshes.

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### Test 1: Basic Flow (3 minutes)

1. **Navigate to builder with prompt**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3001/workflows/[your-flow-id]?prompt=Send%20email%20to%20Slack
   ```

2. **Watch for**:
   - ✅ Agent panel opens (left side, 420px wide)
   - ✅ BuildBadge appears at top: "Thinking..." → "Planning..."
   - ✅ User prompt appears in chat
   - ✅ Plan appears with node list
   - ✅ CostDisplay appears in top-right corner

3. **Click "Build" button**

4. **Watch the animation**:
   - ✅ BuildBadge changes to "Building flow..."
   - ✅ Nodes appear sequentially (count 1... 2... 3...)
   - ✅ Should be ~120ms between each node (not instant, not slow)
   - ✅ Camera zooms to fit all nodes
   - ✅ First node gets blue halo
   - ✅ BuildBadge changes to "Flow ready ✅"

### Test 2: Chat Persistence (1 minute)

1. **After flow builds**, refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
2. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Chat history loads
   - ✅ Your original prompt is still visible
   - ✅ AI's plan is still visible
   - ✅ Status messages appear

**If chat doesn't persist**: Database migration not applied (see step 1 above)

### Test 3: Guided Setup (2 minutes)

1. **After build completes**, first node should be expanded in agent panel
2. **Check for**:
   - ✅ Connection dropdown (if node needs connection)
   - ✅ Required fields shown
   - ✅ Continue/Skip buttons at bottom

3. **Click "Continue"**
   - ✅ Advances to next node
   - ✅ Previous node collapses

4. **Click "Skip"**
   - ✅ Skips current node
   - ✅ Advances to next

### Test 4: Cost Display (1 minute)

1. **After plan generated**, look for badge in top-right corner
2. **Should show**: Estimated cost (e.g., "$0.0023")
3. **Click the badge**
4. **Popover should show**:
   - ✅ Breakdown by provider
   - ✅ Token counts
   - ✅ Cost per operation

### Test 5: Design Tokens (1 minute)

1. **Open browser DevTools** (F12)
2. **Inspect agent panel** (left sidebar)
3. **Measure width**: Should be **420px ± 4px**
4. **Check styles**:
   - ✅ Node gaps look consistent
   - ✅ No visual glitches
   - ✅ Typography sizes look proportional

### Test 6: Reduced Motion (2 minutes - Optional)

1. **Enable "Reduce motion"** in OS accessibility settings:
   - **macOS**: System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion
   - **Windows**: Settings → Ease of Access → Display → Show animations

2. **Submit a new prompt**

3. **Verify**:
   - ✅ Animations are instant (no smooth transitions)
   - ✅ Nodes appear immediately
   - ✅ No easing/delays

4. **Disable "Reduce motion"** when done

## ✅ Success Criteria

After testing, you should have verified:

- ✅ Agent panel 420px wide (not 1120px)
- ✅ BuildBadge shows all stages correctly
- ✅ Nodes animate with ~120ms stagger
- ✅ Chat persists across page refreshes
- ✅ CostDisplay shows in top-right
- ✅ Guided setup Continue/Skip works
- ✅ Camera choreography smooth
- ✅ Blue halo on first node
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in console

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Chat doesn't persist after refresh

**Cause**: Database migration not applied
**Fix**: Apply SQL from `/supabase/migrations/agent_chat_persistence_v2.sql`

### Issue: Agent panel is 1120px wide (not 420px)

**Cause**: Old code cached
**Fix**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: BuildBadge doesn't appear

**Cause**: May be off-screen
**Check**: Browser DevTools → Elements → Search for "BuildBadge"
**Expected**: Position should be `top: 72px, left: 50%`

### Issue: Nodes appear instantly (no animation)

**Cause**: Either "Reduce motion" is enabled OR animation timing issue
**Check**: OS accessibility settings
**Fix**: Disable "Reduce motion" if enabled

### Issue: Cost shows "undefined"

**Cause**: Workflow doesn't use AI nodes (no cost to estimate)
**Expected**: Normal for non-AI workflows

### Issue: Gmail icon warning in dev server

**Cause**: Next.js cache issue
**Impact**: None (code is correct)
**Fix**: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`
