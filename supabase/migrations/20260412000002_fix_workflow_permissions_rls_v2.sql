-- Fix: the FOR ALL policy on workflow_permissions still causes recursion
-- because FOR ALL covers SELECT, and any SELECT on workflow_permissions
-- triggers the policy which calls is_workflow_admin() — even though it's
-- SECURITY DEFINER, the *outer* policy evaluation still recurses.
--
-- Solution: Drop all policies and recreate with explicit per-operation policies.
-- SELECT only checks user_id = auth.uid() (no subquery on self).
-- INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE use the SECURITY DEFINER helper or workflow ownership.

-- Drop all existing policies on workflow_permissions
