 *
 * PARITY TEST — V1 incident: resolver drift across runtime paths.
 *
 * What V1 did wrong:
 *   V1 had at least three resolver paths that all answered "what does
 *   `{{nodeId.field}}` resolve to?" — `lib/workflows/actions/core` action-
 *   layer resolveValue, `lib/execution/variableResolver` DataFlowManager,
 *   and integration-layer resolvers in some provider modules. They drifted
 *   on missing-variable handling: some returned `undefined`, some
 *   preserved the literal `{{...}}` token, some passed the unresolved
 *   string to handlers as-is. Real consequences:
 *     - Slack action posted "{{trigger.payload.text}}" verbatim into
 *       channels.
 *     - Stripe amount fields received "{{trigger.amount}}" → coerced to
 *       NaN cents → silent zero-dollar charges.
 *     - Webhook actions sent literal placeholder strings to external
 *       services that then 200'd without doing anything.
 *
 * The V1 fix landed as the Q2 contract in handler-contracts.md:
 *   "Runtime workflow execution uses strict pre-resolution at the engine
 *    layer. Missing {{...}} references become the standardized config-
 *    failure shape BEFORE action / integration handler dispatch — handlers
 *    never see unresolved templates at runtime."
 *
 * V2's design closes the gap structurally: there is ONE canonical
 * resolver (workflow-engine/variables/resolveValue.ts) with two modes —
 * strict (throws MissingVariableError) for runtime, soft (returns
 * undefined / preserves literal) for builder / preview / planner. The
 * engine catches the strict-mode throw and converts it to a step-level
 * MISSING_VARIABLE failure before the handler can be invoked.
 *
 * THIS TEST is the must-pass case proving V2 doesn't regress to V1's
 * behavior. If V2 ever ships a code path where an unresolved {{...}} can
 * reach a handler, this test fails — and the resolver-drift class of bug
 * is back.
 *
 * Per testing-strategy.md §"Parity tests": cite the V1 incident, exercise
 * the end-to-end contract (not just an isolated unit), and assert
 * specifically on what the V1 bug would have allowed through.
 *
 * --- Lifecycle / categorization note ---
 * This file lives under tests/parity/ because it is positioned as historical
 * V1 parity coverage — the V1 incident is what motivates the test. After V1
 * deletion / Phase 5 cutover the "parity" framing becomes historical: there
 * is no V1 to drift from, but the underlying invariant remains a V2 runtime
 * contract worth defending. At that point this test should be relocated to
 * tests/integration/ (or wherever V2's composition-level test bucket lives)
 * with a small header tweak; the assertions don't change.
 *
 * Invariant guarded by this test (V1 parity AND V2 runtime contract):
 *   Strict runtime variable resolution MUST fail before handler invocation
 *   when required variables are missing. Handlers never receive unresolved
 *   {{...}} templates at runtime — neither standalone nor embedded in
 *   mixed strings.
