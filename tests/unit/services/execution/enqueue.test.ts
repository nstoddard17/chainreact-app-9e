/**
 * @jest-environment node
 *
 * Tests for services/execution/enqueue.ts.
 *
 * Per docs/rules/webhook-receipt-routes.md §"Async dispatch only":
 *   - enqueueRun returns immediately with { runId, enqueuedAt }.
 *   - The engine runs in the background; engine errors don't propagate.
 *   - The dispatcher (caller) treats the return value as "queued";
 *     the webhook returns 200 right after.
