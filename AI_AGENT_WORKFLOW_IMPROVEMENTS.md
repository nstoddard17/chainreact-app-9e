# AI Agent Workflow Improvements - October 23, 2025

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Build**: ✅ PASSING

---

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

All issues from the user's feedback have been resolved:

### 1. ✅ Fixed Redirect to Workflow Builder
**Issue**: User would type a prompt on AI Agent page, but it stayed on the same page instead of redirecting to the workflow builder.

**Fix**: Updated the condition in `AIAgentBuilderContent.tsx` to properly detect first message:
```typescript
// Before: Checked if messages.length === 1 && messages[0].role === 'assistant'
// After: Check if messages.length === 0 (before user's first message is added)
const isFirstMessage = messages.length === 0

if (isFirstMessage) {
  const workflow = await createWorkflow("New Workflow", "Created from AI Agent")
  router.push(`/workflows/builder/${workflow.id}?aiChat=true&initialPrompt=${encodeURIComponent(messageText)}`)
  return
}
```

**File**: `components/workflows/ai-builder/AIAgentBuilderContent.tsx:509`

---

### 2. ✅ Changed "Integrations" to "Apps" Throughout
**Issue**: AI said "integrations" but the UI calls them "apps".

**Changes**:
- System prompt: "Checking which apps are connected" (not integrations)
- Action type: `connect_app` (not `connect_integration`)
- Metadata: `appConnected` (not `integrationConnected`)
- UI text: "Connected: [App]" / "Connect [App]"

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/ai/workflow-builder/route.ts:111, 118, 190, 200, 587, 590`
- `components/workflows/ai-builder/AIWorkflowBuilderChat.tsx:39, 44, 169, 247, 498, 502, 507`

---

### 3. ✅ AI Now Continues Processing (Doesn't Stop)
**Issue**: AI would say "Let's check your integrations" and then stop.

**Fix**: Added a structured 3-step workflow process to the system prompt:

**STEP 1 - Verify Apps & Present Plan (actionType: "plan_workflow")**:
- Check which apps are needed
- Verify all are connected (if not, prompt connection)
- If connected: Present complete plan in ONE response
- Include numbered list of steps
- Ask "Ready to proceed?"

**STEP 2 - User Confirms**:
- User clicks "Continue Building" button
- Button sends "Yes, continue building the workflow"

**STEP 3 - Build Workflow (actionType: "add_node")**:
- AI adds nodes ONE AT A TIME
- Shows progress: "✓ Adding [Node Name]..."
- Continues until complete
- Final message: "✓ Workflow complete!"

**File**: `app/api/ai/workflow-builder/route.ts:190-216`

---

### 4. ✅ Added Confirmation Step with Planned Actions
**Issue**: Should show what steps it will create and ask for confirmation.

**Implementation**:
Added new action type `plan_workflow` that includes:
- Human-readable plan in message
- `metadata.workflowSteps` array with planned nodes
- "Continue Building" button in UI

**Example Response**:
```json
{
  "actionType": "plan_workflow",
  "message": "Perfect! I can see you have Gmail and Slack connected. ✓\n\nHere's the workflow I'll build for you:\n\n1. **Gmail Trigger** - Triggers when new email arrives\n2. **Slack Action** - Sends message to Slack channel\n\nReady to proceed? Click 'Continue' and I'll start building this workflow step by step.",
  "metadata": {
    "workflowSteps": [
      {
        "nodeType": "gmail_trigger_new_email",
        "nodeName": "Gmail Trigger",
        "description": "Triggers when new email arrives"
      },
      {
        "nodeType": "slack_action_send_message",
        "nodeName": "Slack Action",
        "description": "Sends message to Slack channel"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `app/api/ai/workflow-builder/route.ts:193-209, 231, 245-252`
- `components/workflows/ai-builder/AIWorkflowBuilderChat.tsx:39, 45-49, 518-537`

---

### 5. ✅ Shows Real-Time Building Progress
**Issue**: Should show workflow being built in real-time.

**Implementation**:
- System prompt instructs AI to say "✓ Adding [Node Name]..." for each node
- Each node addition creates a new message in chat
- User sees progress as workflow is constructed
- Final confirmation when complete

**File**: `app/api/ai/workflow-builder/route.ts:211-216`

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### New Action Type: `plan_workflow`
Added to support the confirmation step before building.

**When to use**: First response when user requests a workflow and all apps are connected

**Response format**:
```typescript
{
  actionType: 'plan_workflow',
  message: 'Human-readable plan with numbered steps',
  metadata: {
    workflowSteps: [
      { nodeType: string, nodeName: string, description: string }
    ]
  }
}
```

### New UI Component: Continue Building Button
Shows when `message.actionType === 'plan_workflow'`

**Behavior**:
- Appears below the plan message
- Sends "Yes, continue building the workflow" when clicked
- Triggers AI to start adding nodes
- Disabled while loading

**Location**: `components/workflows/ai-builder/AIWorkflowBuilderChat.tsx:518-537`
