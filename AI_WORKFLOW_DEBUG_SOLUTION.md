# AI Workflow Builder Debug Solution

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Nodes Not Showing Configuration Fields**

**Problem**: Nodes were showing gray skeleton loaders but not actual configuration fields.

**Root Cause**:
- The `showConfigSkeleton` condition was `!hasConfigEntries && ['preparing', 'creating', 'configuring'].includes(aiStatus)`
- Config fields weren't being added to the node's config object properly

**Solution Added**:
- Ensured `field_configured` events properly update the node's config object
- Added logging to track field configuration: `console.log('[FRONTEND] Adding field to node config:', fieldKey, '=', fieldValue)`

### 2. **Nodes Starting Before Previous Completes**

**Problem**: Second node was displaying before first node finished configuration.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient delays between events to allow UI to process updates.

**Solution Added**:
- Increased delays between major state transitions:
  - After `node_creating`: 1200ms (was 800ms)
  - After `node_created`: 500ms (new)
  - After `node_configuring`: 500ms (new)
  - Between fields: 300ms (was 100ms)
  - After configuration: 500ms (new)
  - After completion: 1500ms (maintained)

### 3. **Status Not Progressing Properly**

**Problem**: Nodes weren't showing the proper status progression (Preparing → Configuring → Testing → Complete).

**Root Cause**:
- `aiBadgeText` was set to 'Configuring' during the 'preparing' phase
- Status updates weren't being forced in event handlers

**Solution Added**:
- Fixed `aiBadgeText: 'Preparing'` in node_creating handler
- Forced correct `aiStatus` values in all event handlers
- Added comprehensive logging to track status changes

## Debug Logging Added

The following debug logs have been added to help diagnose issues:

### Backend (`/app/api/ai/stream-workflow/route.ts`):
```
[STREAM] Sending node_creating for {title} ({nodeId})
[STREAM] Starting configuration for {title} ({nodeId})
[STREAM] Configuring {count} fields for {title}
[STREAM] Setting field {key} = {value} for {title}
[STREAM] Skipping test for trigger {title}
```

### Frontend (`/components/workflows/NewWorkflowBuilderContent.tsx`):
```
[FRONTEND] node_creating event: {eventData}
[FRONTEND] Updating node to preparing: {nodeId}
[FRONTEND] node_configuring event: {eventData}
[FRONTEND] Updating node to configuring: {nodeId}
[FRONTEND] field_configured event: {eventData}
[FRONTEND] Adding field to node config: {key} = {value}
```

## What You Should See Now

### For Trigger Nodes:
1. **Preparing** (gray border) - 1.2 seconds
2. **Configuring** (blue border) - Fields added one by one
3. **Complete** (green border) - No testing phase

### For Action Nodes:
1. **Preparing** (gray border) - 1.2 seconds
2. **Configuring** (blue border) - Fields added one by one
3. **Testing** (yellow border) - Validates configuration
4. **Complete** (green border) - Shows test data

## Debugging Steps

To diagnose remaining issues:

1. **Open Browser Console** (F12)
2. **Watch for Log Messages**:
   - Look for `[FRONTEND]` messages to see event flow
   - Check if fields are being added: "Adding field to node config"
   - Verify status updates: "Updating node to {status}"

3. **Common Issues to Check**:
   - If fields don't appear: Check if `config` object is being updated
   - If nodes overlap: Check timing logs
   - If status stuck: Look for missing event handlers

## Key Files Modified

1. **`/app/api/ai/stream-workflow/route.ts`**:
   - Added debug logging for all major events
   - Increased delays for better UI synchronization
   - Fixed trigger node completion flow

2. **`/components/workflows/NewWorkflowBuilderContent.tsx`**:
   - Added debug logging for event processing
   - Fixed status badge text ('Preparing' vs 'Configuring')
   - Ensured config object updates properly

3. **`/components/workflows/CustomNode.tsx`**:
   - Added AI status-based border colors
   - Shows skeleton loaders during configuration

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open browser console before testing
- [ ] Try creating a workflow with a trigger + action
- [ ] Watch console for event sequence
- [ ] Verify each node shows: Preparing → Configuring → (Testing) → Complete
- [ ] Check that fields appear in Configuration section
- [ ] Confirm test data appears in Test Data section
- [ ] Ensure each node completes before next starts

## If Issues Persist

Look for these patterns in console:

1. **No field_configured events**: Configuration generation might be failing
2. **No config updates**: Check if `optimizedOnNodesChange` is working
3. **Rapid status changes**: Delays might need adjustment
4. **Missing nodes**: Check if `node_created` events are processed

The debug logs will help identify exactly where the flow breaks down.
