/**
 * Pure workflow lifecycle state machine.
 *
 * Per docs/rules/workflow-lifecycle.md (Resolved Decisions):
 *   - Six states: draft, active, paused, disabled, eligible_to_resume, deleted.
 *   - Single state machine; transitions go through one orchestrator
 *     (services/workflows/lifecycleOrchestrator.ts).
 *   - draft -> disabled is explicitly disallowed (drafts have no trigger
 *     registration; nothing to disable).
 *   - disabled -> active directly is disallowed; must transit
 *     eligible_to_resume so the user explicitly resumes.
 *   - deleted is NO LONGER terminal (4.WORKFLOW-FOLDERS-4 / WF-3): a soft-deleted
 *     workflow sits in Trash for 7 days and can be restored via the `restore`
 *     transition back to `draft`. Restore is the ONLY transition out of deleted;
 *     a restored workflow is inactive (draft) and must be re-activated explicitly,
 *     so restore never re-registers triggers.
 *
 * This module is deliberately I/O-free. The cascade predicates
 * (selectWorkflowsToDisable, selectWorkflowsEligibleToResume) consume a
 * pre-computed dependency view supplied by the service layer; integration
 * dependency lookup itself lives in services/workflows/ once the workflow
 * definition is formalized (Slice 1I+).
