/**
 * Pure humanizer for engine + handler errors.
 *
 * Converts the engine's failure codes (MISSING_VARIABLE, MISSING_HANDLER,
 * HANDLER_FAILED, WORKFLOW_NOT_FOUND, TRIGGER_NODE_NOT_FOUND) and the
 * provider-specific Slack codes (channel_not_found, not_in_channel,
 * invalid_auth, http_<status>, …) into a user-facing
 * {title, description, hint?, action?, severity} shape.
 *
 * Lives in core/ because it has zero I/O and is consumed by both the
 * engine (writes the classification on the workflow_runs row) and the
 * UI (renders run history). Per project-structure §"Error humanization":
 * core/errors/humanizeActionError.ts.
 *
 * Action codes route the UI's CTA button:
 *   - reconnect    → /integrations
 *   - open_node    → builder with the failed node focused
 *   - upgrade_plan → /subscription (Slice 1N billing)
