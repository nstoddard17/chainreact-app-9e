## Notes & Discoveries

### Known Issues
- (Will track issues as we discover them)

### Technical Decisions
- **Node State Management**: Implemented as optional fields on FlowNodeData to maintain backward compatibility
- **Styling Approach**: Using inline styles for state-specific borders/colors and CSS classes for animations
- **Preview Blocks**: Support both string and string array content for flexibility

### Future Enhancements
- (Will track nice-to-have features)

## Testing Instructions - Phase 1: Node Visual Foundation

### Quick Start: Using the Test Panel (Recommended)

**I've created a test panel component to make testing super easy!**

1. **Add the test panel** to WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx:

   ```typescript
   // At the top of the file, add import:
   import { NodeStateTestPanel } from './NodeStateTestPanel'

   // Inside the JSX, add anywhere (I suggest near the bottom):
   <NodeStateTestPanel />
   ```

2. **Start the dev server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open the Workflow Builder V2** in your browser

4. **Click the "ðŸ§ª Test Node States" button** in the bottom-right corner

5. **Add test nodes** by clicking the buttons for each state:
   - Skeleton Node - Grey, muted appearance with "Building..." badge
   - Ready Node - Normal appearance, no badge
   - Running Node - Blue wave animation with "Running" badge
   - Passed Node - Green border with "See results" badge
   - Failed Node - Red border with "Failed" badge

6. **Verify each state** matches the checklist below

7. **Clean up** when done:
   - Click "Clear All Test Nodes" to remove test nodes
   - Remove the `<NodeStateTestPanel />` component from WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx
   - Remove the import

### Alternative: Manual Testing via Console

If you prefer manual testing, you can modify nodes in the browser console:

   ```javascript
   // Get the ReactFlow instance (this is a simplified approach)
   // In practice, you'll need to access the nodes through the builder's state

   // Example: Update first node to 'skeleton' state
   {
     state: 'skeleton',
     description: 'This node is being built by AI...'
   }

   // Example: Update to 'running' state
   {
     state: 'running',
     description: 'Executing workflow step...',
     preview: {
       title: 'Sample Data',
       content: ['Processing item 1...', 'Processing item 2...']
     }
   }

   // Example: Update to 'passed' state
   {
     state: 'passed',
     description: 'Successfully completed!',
     preview: {
       title: 'Results',
       content: 'Found 42 records matching criteria'
     }
   }

   // Example: Update to 'failed' state
   {
     state: 'failed',
     description: 'An error occurred during execution'
   }
   ```

4. **What to verify for each state:**

   **Skeleton State:**
   - [ ] Node has muted grey background (50% opacity)
   - [ ] Border is light and semi-transparent
   - [ ] Text is muted foreground color
   - [ ] "Building..." badge appears with grey styling
   - [ ] Description text is visible and grey

   **Ready State (default):**
   - [ ] Node has normal card background
   - [ ] Standard border color
   - [ ] No status badge shown
   - [ ] Normal text colors

   **Running State:**
   - [ ] Blue animated wave moves across the node (2s cycle)
   - [ ] "Running" badge appears with blue styling
   - [ ] Wave animation is smooth and continuous
   - [ ] Description and preview are visible if provided
   - [ ] If reduced motion is enabled, animation stops (static blue tint)

   **Passed State:**
   - [ ] Green border (2px solid)
   - [ ] Subtle green shadow around node
   - [ ] "See results" badge appears with green styling
   - [ ] Badge is clickable with hover effect
   - [ ] Preview block shows results data

   **Failed State:**
   - [ ] Red border (2px solid)
   - [ ] Subtle red shadow around node
   - [ ] "Failed" badge appears with red styling
   - [ ] Description explains the error

5. **Test Preview Blocks:**
   - [ ] Preview with title shows title in bold above content
   - [ ] Preview with string content displays as single paragraph
   - [ ] Preview with array content displays as separate lines
   - [ ] Preview block is scrollable when content exceeds 120px height
   - [ ] Preview has light grey background

6. **Test Description Field:**
   - [ ] Description appears below title/sublabel when provided
   - [ ] Description text is readable with proper line height
   - [ ] Description doesn't break node layout

### Alternative Testing Approach

If direct state modification is difficult, you can also:

1. Add a test button in the UI that cycles through states
2. Use React DevTools to modify node data directly
3. Create a test workflow with pre-configured node states

### Expected Behavior Summary

- Node states should visually change immediately when data updates
- Animations should be smooth and performant
- Text should remain readable in all states
- Preview blocks should handle long content gracefully
- Badges should clearly indicate current state

**Report any issues with:**
- Colors not matching
- Animations not running
- Text not visible
- Layout breaking
- Preview blocks not scrolling
