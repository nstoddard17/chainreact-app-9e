# Removed Old V2 Components - Oct 30, 2025

## Summary
Removed old Flow V2 page routes and components that were superseded by WorkflowBuilderV2.

## Files Removed

### 1. Old Page Routes
- `app/workflows/v2/[flowId]/page.tsx` - Old flow builder page that used FlowBuilderClient
- `app/workflows/v2/page.tsx` - Old list page for v2 flows
- `app/workflows/v2/templates/page.tsx` - Old templates page

### 2. Old Components
- `src/components/workflowsV2/FlowBuilderClient.tsx` - Legacy builder component
- `src/components/workflowsV2/` - Entire directory removed (now empty)

## What Was Kept

### API Routes (Still Used by WorkflowBuilderV2)
All API routes in `app/workflows/v2/api/` were kept because they are actively used:
- `/workflows/v2/api/flows/` - Flow management APIs
- `/workflows/v2/api/runs/` - Execution APIs
- `/workflows/v2/api/schedules/` - Scheduling APIs
- `/workflows/v2/api/templates/` - Template APIs
- `/workflows/v2/api/trigger/` - Trigger APIs
- `/workflows/v2/api/secrets/` - Secrets management
- `/workflows/v2/api/health/` - Health check
- `/workflows/v2/api/demo/` - Demo flows

**Verification:** See `src/lib/workflows/builder/useFlowV2Builder.ts` lines 293-671 for API usage.

## Current Workflow Builder Routes

### Active Route
- `/workflows/builder/[id]` - **Current workflow builder** using WorkflowBuilderV2 component

### Component Location
- `components/workflows/builder/WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx` - Main builder component

## Database Tables
Both old and new builders used the same tables:
- `flow_v2_definitions` - Flow definitions
- `flow_v2_revisions` - Flow revisions/versions

## Why This Was Safe
1. ✅ WorkflowBuilderV2 uses the same API routes that were kept
2. ✅ WorkflowBuilderV2 uses the same database tables
3. ✅ No functionality was lost - only duplicate/outdated UI components were removed
4. ✅ All workflows are still accessible via `/workflows/builder/[id]`

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Navigate to `/workflows` - List page works
- [ ] Click on a workflow - Opens in `/workflows/builder/[id]`
- [ ] Create a new workflow - Opens in builder
- [ ] All builder features work (AI agent, integrations, etc.)
- [ ] Navigating to old routes results in 404 (expected)

## Related Changes
As part of AI Agent rebuild (Phase 1), also added:
- `components/workflows/builder/NodeStateTestPanel.tsx` - Testing utility for node states
- Import added to WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx line 44
- Component added to WorkflowBuilderV2.tsx line 865
