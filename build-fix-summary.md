# Build Fix Summary

## Issue

The build was failing with the following error:

\`\`\`
Module not found: Can't resolve '@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs'
\`\`\`

This was because the `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` package was not installed but was being imported in the `app/api/cron/refresh-tokens-simple/route.ts` file.

## Changes Made

1. **Dependency Updates**:
   - Added `@supabase/supabase-js` for direct Supabase client usage
   - Note: We initially tried `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` but it was deprecated in favor of `@supabase/ssr`

2. **Code Changes**:
   - Updated `app/api/cron/refresh-tokens-simple/route.ts` to use `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js` instead of the auth helpers
   - Configured the client to use the service role key for admin access
   - Updated the code to properly handle the async `getSecret` function

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Created a script to generate a `.env.local` file with placeholder values for required environment variables
   - Ensured the encryption key is properly set

## Key Improvements

1. **Simplified Authentication**: 
   - Using the direct Supabase client with service role key is more appropriate for a cron job than the auth helpers
   - This approach doesn't rely on cookies or user sessions

2. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added comprehensive error handling for token decryption
   - Implemented cleanup mode to fix corrupted tokens
   - Added detailed logging and statistics tracking

3. **Improved Security**:
   - Properly validating tokens before attempting decryption
   - Securely handling encryption keys

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the Changes**:
   - Push the updated code to your repository
   - Ensure the proper environment variables are set in your Vercel project

2. **Run Cleanup Mode**:
   - After deployment, access the refresh-tokens-simple endpoint with `?cleanup=true` to clean up corrupted tokens
   - Monitor the logs to ensure the cleanup process works correctly

3. **Monitor Token Health**:
   - Regularly check the logs for decryption errors
   - Consider implementing a more comprehensive token health monitoring system
