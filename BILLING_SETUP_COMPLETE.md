# âœ… Billing Setup Complete

## What Was Fixed
1. **Stripe Price IDs Configured**: The Pro plan now has valid Stripe price IDs for both monthly and annual billing
   - Monthly: `price_1S5T7fE0kRcRLm9RMhTf19VJ` ($19.99/month)
   - Yearly: `price_1S5T6OE0kRcRLm9RQKLQY7iB` ($179.99/year)

2. **Upgrade Button Functionality**: The "Upgrade to Pro" button now correctly:
   - Respects the monthly/annual toggle selection
   - Creates a Stripe checkout session with the correct price
   - Redirects to Stripe's hosted checkout page

## How It Works
1. User selects Monthly or Annual billing cycle
2. User clicks "Upgrade to Pro" button
3. System creates a Stripe checkout session with the selected billing period
4. User is redirected to Stripe checkout
5. After successful payment, user is redirected back to the settings page

## Testing the Implementation
1. Navigate to Settings > Billing tab
2. Toggle between "Monthly" and "Annual" - notice the price changes
3. Click "Upgrade to Pro"
4. You'll be redirected to Stripe checkout
5. Use test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242` (any future expiry, any CVC)
6. Complete the checkout
7. You'll be redirected back to the settings page with `?success=true`
