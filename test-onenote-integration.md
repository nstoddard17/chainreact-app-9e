# OneNote Integration Test Guide

## 🎯 **Test Your OneNote Integration Now**

The OneNote integration has been updated to be more aggressive about finding real notebooks and less likely to fall back to virtual ones.

### 📋 **Step-by-Step Test:**

1. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Sign in** to your account
3. **Go to Workflows page**
4. **Create a new workflow**
5. **Add a OneNote action** (like "Create Page" or "Create Section")
6. **Check the notebook dropdown**

### 🔍 **What You Should See:**

#### ✅ **If Integration Works Properly:**
- **Real notebooks**: All your actual OneNote notebooks listed
- **New notebooks**: Any newly created notebooks should appear
- **No virtual notebooks**: Should not see "My OneNote Notebook" unless you actually have one

#### ❌ **If Integration Still Has Issues:**
- **Empty dropdown**: No notebooks shown
- **Virtual notebooks**: Only seeing "My OneNote Notebook" 
- **Missing new notebooks**: New notebooks not appearing

### 🛠️ **What Was Fixed:**

1. **Removed virtual notebook fallback** - No more fake notebooks
2. **Enhanced OneDrive search** - More comprehensive file searching
3. **Multiple search strategies** - Tries different API endpoints and search methods
4. **Better error handling** - Clear error messages instead of fake data

### 📊 **Expected Behavior:**

- **First time**: May take a moment to search all locations
- **Subsequent times**: Should be faster and show all notebooks
- **New notebooks**: Should appear automatically without re-connecting

### 🔧 **If Still Not Working:**

1. **Check browser console** for any error messages
2. **Try refreshing the page** and testing again
3. **Check if OneNote API is accessible** via Microsoft Graph Explorer
4. **Verify integration status** in your account settings

### 📝 **Report Back:**

Please test the integration and let me know:
1. **What notebooks you see** in the dropdown
2. **Whether new notebooks appear** automatically
3. **Any error messages** in the browser console
4. **Overall behavior** compared to before

This will help us determine if the fix is working or if we need to make additional adjustments.
