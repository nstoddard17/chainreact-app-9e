3. **Context-aware AI**: Our AI sees the entire workflow, not just individual steps
4. **Human collaboration**: HITL lets humans and AI work together seamlessly
5. **Deep integrations**: Real OAuth, webhooks, bidirectional sync—not just API calls
6. **Visual intelligence**: See AI decisions, routing, and reasoning in real-time

### What Makes ChainReact Unique (Positioning Statement)

## Key Differentiators (Reframed)

Instead of "We're better than Zapier because...", say:

**Traditional approach**: "Set rules, hope they work, manually fix when they break"
**ChainReact approach**: "AI understands context, accesses your documents, and asks when unsure"

**Traditional approach**: "Connect apps via API"
**ChainReact approach**: "Deep integrations with OAuth, webhooks, and bidirectional sync"

**Traditional approach**: "Automation runs blindly"
**ChainReact approach**: "See every decision, pause for input, collaborate with AI in real-time"
